Wake up, get paid
'Nother dollar, 'nother day
Go and throw it all away
On Cartier
Creme de la creme
Put my faith in the fun
It's a ritual I live
Tonic and gin

I've been seeing saints holding hands
And my God is trans
And everyone feels alive
And I like to do what's in Vogue
Not what I've been told
Cross my heart and hope to die

Maybe I overcompensate
Call it my naïveté
But I don't wanna go through the motions
Maybe I put it on display
Say some things I shouldn't say
'Cause I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions

And I'm not sure
Of anything but couture
And you can say ""c'est la amour""
What I live for
It's all first class
When I'm burning through the cash
When the jet starts to crash
Beautiful trash

I've been seeing saints holding hands
And my God is trans
And everyone feels alive
And I like to do what's in Vogue
Not what I've been told
Cross my heart and hope to die

Maybe I overcompensate
Call it my naïveté
But I don't wanna go through the motions
Maybe I put it on display
Say some things I shouldn't say
'Cause I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions

It's all Chanel, go straight to hell
I wish you well, I kiss and tell
My soul to sell 'cause I don't wanna go through the motions
Yves Saint Laurent, do what you want
Light cigarettes and restaurants
I preach it wrong
'Cause I don't wanna go through the motions

Maybe I overcompensate
Call it my naïveté
But I don't wanna go through the motions
Maybe I put it on display
Say some things I shouldn't say
'Cause I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions

Dame la muerte chiquita
Dame la muerte pequeña
Y así tal vez en tus brazos alcanzaré gracia plena
Su esencia de alta marea
Sus besos de tamarindo
Sus pestañas dos palmeras a cuyo vaivén me rindo

New breed
Stop calling me ambitious when I dream farther than Curry's three point range
It's not a compliment when you doubt my success in a polite way
I'm used to being the underdog 'cause black girls who have minds and a cause are stifled with leashes and clichés
But we new breeds
We run over insults and fuck niggas like Bobby Boucher
We new breeds
We coast over doubts like Tony Hawk in the prime of his X Games

I had to be the one to learn the shit the hard way
Pick up the pieces even though I wasn't the one to blame
No excuses 'cause it only made up my game
Grind up, gotta keep my grind up
I wasn't chasing nothing that was never mine to take
Rockin' the best, dressed head to toe in my mistakes
I got that type of shit, that type of shit don't ever fade
Shine up, gotta keep my shine up

So won't you put that pressure on me?
'Cause then you'll see the best in me

Darling, you ain't notice
But that don't mean we ain't diamonds
And even though we're broken
That don't mean we ain't diamonds
I know that we ain't polished
But that don't mean we ain't diamonds
We rough around the edges
But that don't mean we ain't diamonds

What I got up in my pocket don't come easily
I had to drop it off gwaf it ain't pleasing me
Never play with people that's prepared to cheat on me
Eyes up, got to keep your eyes up
I wake up every morning and I'm feeling hella free
Paid my dues so I can do this shit the way I please
I've been on my grind, I've been waiting patiently
Hustle up, gotta keep your hustle up

So won't you put that pressure on me?
'Cause then you'll see the best in me

Darling, you ain't notice
But that don't mean we ain't diamonds (That don't mean we)
And even though we're broken
That don't mean we ain't diamonds (We)
I know that we ain't polished
But that don't mean we ain't diamonds (That don't mean)
We rough around the edges
But that don't mean we ain't diamonds

We were made under the weight of mountains
So we can take whatever you throw at us

And even though we're broken

Traigo en los bolsillos tanta soledad
Desde que te fuiste no me queda mas
Que una foto gris y un triste sentimiento
Lo que mas lastima es tanta confusion
En cada resquicio de mi corazon
Como hacerte a un lado de mis pensamientos
Por ti, por ti, por ti
He dejado todo sin mirar atras
Aposte la vida y me deje ganar
Te extrao porque vive en mi tu recuerdo te olvido
A cada minuto lo intento te amo es que ya no tengo remedio
Te extrao, te olvido y te amo de nuevo
Te extrao porque vive en mi tu recuerdo te olvido
A cada minuto lo intento te amo es que ya no tengo remedio
Te extrao, te olvido y te amo de nuevo
He perdido todo, hasta la identidad
Y si lo pidieras mas podria dar
Es que cuando se ama, nada es demasiado
Me enseaste el limite da la pasion
Y no me enseaste a decir adios
He aprendido ahora que te has marchado
Por ti, por ti, por ti
He dejado todo sin mirar atras
Aposte la vida y me deje ganar

Woo...grand groove, grand groove
Woo...grand groove, grand groove

Rough, rough, rugged
Tough like a nugget
Listen to The Abstract Poetic, don't snub it
The midnight marauder is the hype beat arranger
Don't front on my lyrics or the tool 'cause it's danger
Hook you like a junkie, you'll flip like a monkey
To the openness of the rhythm, so proceed because I'm funky
I get down, down like a fly hooker's panties
Make you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny
I be the fly poet, rappers, they get jelly
Upset when I rock, 'cause yo, they rhymes is smelly
See, I got it going on like a Forbes tax return
Listening to these lyrics when it's hot will make it burn
Baby burn, baby burn, up into the heavens
The skies up above, the one you think of
Is the highly regarded, hell of the people
Your mic and my mic? Come on, yo, no equal (Word!)
So if ya wanna do it to yourself
That is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself
'Cause you made your bed, so now you lay in it
That's your shit on the floor, then go and play in it
I refuse to catch a 'L' in a battle
'Cause yo, I got the jazz and I'll whup a rapper's ass
Into little next to nuthin'
Test me if I'm frontin'
I'll pass with flying colors 'cause yo, I am that brotha that can rock

Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)

Come on, come on, Phife

No need for introductions 'cause you know who I be
(The Phife Dawg) Yep, the one who loves to slaugher MC's
I got style, grace and razamatazz
I'm like my girl Patrice Rushen, yo, I add pizzazz, now
Most people remember Phife from the Phife like smoothness
But now it's time to hit you with roughneck rudeness
I'm still vexed, fuming, gots to come raw
The first punk that tries to flex, I'll be cracking your jaw
I'll mold you, fold you, roll you up like a spliff
Don't ever try for test or else that ass will get whipped
I'm forever poppin' junk, it's like a fat invite
To any MC who wants to flex, yo, we can do this tonight
Gel up my posse up on Linden and 1-9-2
Pull up my brothas from Sayers Ave., the Brooklyn Zoo
All my crew up in Strong Island, so yo, don't sleep
'Cause it only takes a beat to watch that ass get beat
Brothas wanna play rough, but they can all get some
Wanna be hero, but you're a zero, that means you gets none
Don't ever try to step to a kid you can't get with
Why mess with a brotha that your girl once slept with?
I'm a negro, he's a negro, wanna be a negro too?
But beatin' on a girl, is somethin' that a puss' would do
I love jazz, but that doesn't mean that I'm timid
Not really a gangsta rapper but I can swing it for a minute

Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)

Ah baby, ah baby, ah baby, ah baby
Go ooh...ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...grand groove, grand groove

All we want in this life
Is peace, prosperity and a little paper
Objects, they seem greater
But I'm sure we overcome when we illin' on a drum

We in a world that places heavy emphasis on money synthesis
Y'all can be my witnesses
That a fella fascination with money has grown
To the point that he will shit on his own
We got to have it y'all, its not a Spike Lee cinematic
A piece of paper making niggas get dramatic
But the money doesn't come automatic
Gotta motivate ourselves to go and grab it
We got to get it y'all, in an orderly fashion
Some cats go about it with too much passion
We got to mediate our greedy levels
'Cause the lust of currency can have us sleepin with the devil
Gotta recognize it, realize the power
That this little ma-huckin piece of paper will devour
Man can be greater than the thing he creates
See, I'mma do my thing and see how much I can scrape
Yo, I'd rather have respect than money, no doubt
But listen to me y'all, I want the mass amount
That the Sesame Street Dracula can't Count
So that I can give my people when that thing surmounts
To higher levels.. of being.. so when I'm MC-ing
I hope to see you there steady G-ing (say word)
But the only way we can truly reach that goal
Is finding true inner peace and prospering souls
It's like that


Here comes your royal highness, one of Queens finest
Believe me, honest, you know you can't stop it
Come on son, never leave your mic 'round me
True MC for real, ask my man Shaheed
Strictly focused on what I'm in this rap game for
Not for fame and screwing every whore after whore
With all that AIDS stuff going round
Tell me how that sound
Rather hit the studio and hear some beats that pound
Now, don't get me wrong, I love honeys galore
But see hip-hop's my bread and butter
'Cause that's what I get paid for
See this is what I wanted, Allah helped me to get it
And if the beat is wicked, you know Malik will rip it
From the bottom of my heart, that's where the love starts
The love for breakdancing, my love for the art
And with this love I do hip-hop from the soul
A real MC, who never sweats how many copies are sold
Yeah, I want to go gold, platinum, uh-huh, etcetera
But why put out some wackness when no one will respect ya?
I'm staying true, nuff respect to those that paved the way
From Bambaataa down to Shah; that be my DJ
Without my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it, word
Sometimes I feel that my career is headed for the curb
One love for lending hand and giving all your help
Believing in me when I didn't believe in my own self
The Abstract with whom I'm always making rugged tunes
Kid Hood resting in heaven, I hope to see you soon
I keep things hot and this year they're even hotter
Big Mu and Shah, one day I'll take my shahada

It's been a minute since I called you
Just to hear the answerphone
Yeah, I know that you won't get this
But I'll leave a message so I'm not alone
This morning I woke up still dreaming
With memories playing through my head
You'll never know how much I miss you
The day that they took you, I wish it was me instead

But you once told me, ""Don't give up
You can do it day by day""
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away

So I will keep you, day and night, here until the day I die
I'll be living one life for the two of us
I will be the best of me, always keep you next to me
I'll be living one life for the two of us
Even when I'm on my own, I know I won't be alone
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song
I know you'll be looking down, swear I'm gonna make you proud
I'll be living one life for the two of us

I could feel your blood run through me
You're written in my DNA
Looking back in every mirror
I know you'll be waiting, I'll see you again

But you once told me, ""Don't give up
You can do it day by day""
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away (Fade away)

I won’t stop 'til I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from
I won’t stop 'til I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

Yo, first grade, Oak Street elementary
A few blocks from the Inglewood cemetery
I lived through hard times, according to my memory
Then I learned to rhyme like I’m reading off the dictionary
I still walk to the Kelso Market
Even though I get to walk them red carpets
My family lived in my grandpa’s garage
So I started working just to help out my pops
It all started when my grandpa crossed over
Now one day I'mma be a crossover
Right now it’s just who is that girl?
But one day I'mma be all around the world
I still get grounded, always stay grounded
Still do chores even when I’m on tour
One thing’s for sure, I'mma always be me
That West Side Becky, Becky, Becky G

I won’t stop 'til I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from
I won’t stop 'til I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

Yo, what you know about the In-N-Out life?
And what you know about that 405 drive?
My life is changing quickly right before my eyes
It hits me every time that I’m on Hollywood and Vine
If you wanna date me, you gotta ask my daddy
And my 30 uncles, you can meet them in an alley
And one day I'mma bring home a Grammy
But no matter what I’ll be bringing home Randy's Donuts
So what, holler when you see me
I’m still the same B, even when I’m on TV
Still rocking Js with my diamonds and pearls
You can take me out the hood, but not the hood out of the girl
Yes I love sushi, love my calamari
But ain't no better chef than my very own mommy
If you can’t catch me roaming in my barrio
I’m with my 'litas praying the Rosario
(Inglewood, Inglewood, Inglewood)

I won’t stop 'til I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block

No matter where I go I know where I came from

No, I ain't talkin' 'bout my word, just my work
You can add it all up while I'm beefin' up my purse

Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine

And baby, worship me (worship me)
Worship me (get it together, make it feel good)

Like my hands in the air
Fingers kiss the sky
Smile on my lips, and I don't know why
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
With myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love

Kissing on my mirror
Staring in my eyes
Appreciating every curve and crevice
Smack my thighs
Smack it twice, watch it jiggle
You a bad batch cookie, cream filling in the middle
I'm a very picky girl
And yes you can call me mama
I got an A in self-esteem
So save the drama for Obama
Presidential in my stature
Statuesque and big as hell
If you in love with what you do, then leave them thirsties by the well
If they talking bout you, let 'em
You they entertainment
Reading you yo rights, just make it rain what they arraignin'
It's raining, it's pouring
Men in they're boring
Hallelujah thanking Jesus he made men so they could please us
All these years been searching for something that would complete me
Who knew that it would be me

I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love

Okay, this verse is about my best friend, bad as she can be
The only one that's on her level happens to be me
She'll give you a sprinkle, to them flounders bottom feeding
But ween 'em, as quick as she get that peen
And ditch like a queen can
, after dinner I like that dessert
But he thirsty like he in the desert
What's worse, give it to him or get my own
Think I'm bout to hit him with that scissor
Cut, print, this scene is done
Nice to know, you all so nice to know
Level son, you on level one
I'm like ding, ding, ding, elevation
All my beautiful, big black beauty girls
Brown paper bag,  coke can, 
Light skin, curly hair
Afro, in the air
Love yourself like nobody else can

Like my hands in the air
Fingers kiss the sky
Smile on my lips, and I don't know why
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
With myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love

Oh my god

LA carolin' with Carolyn
Caroline but I had to make it rhyme, I'm
Addicted to that weather like heroin
That is why I cannot give it any time, just say no!
It's too good to me, you are too good to me
O.D. on compliments, I need some oxygen
So I dip to the PNW, some of ya don't need where that is - good!
Need a little solitude with my crew
'Membering what's real is what makes you you, oh!
It's too good to me, know it's no good for me
I can't be out here homie, what it used to be
Sitting in bed like ""man!"", wishing
Itching for days with no end
Sound checks, checks in, audiences rapping
Getting full of that adrenaline, eat it up like Satan
You can't have it? Take it, you can't man up? K then
Breaking up my cadence, got that willpower like Jaden, blaow!

And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

Flying into Paris with Sophia Eris
Had a heart-to-heart over fresh croissant
Wondering why these dudes be tripping
She like ""Girl I'm past giving a damn!""
YOLO, guess that's why he want a photo
Dressed in Polo, arm around me after the show
But never there when I need hoes
Open mind but my heart closed, ah!
Where ya been? Back again, young man?
I remember you from way way when
You never gave it or reciprocated
But when I bounced for my sake, you peeped your mistake
""She left me"" is always the excuse
I swear there should be support groups for men without Lizzo
Meet once a week and deal with y'all issues
Google me and jack off in a tissue

Yeah! You know what though?
We keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

I will never be the person that you want me to
Feeling like I can't amount in what I'm 'sposed to do
But I'm here now, like how this happen?
Head in the pillows, I'm crunching on Cap'n
I'm chilling, I swear I been chilling
Taking a break, feeling hella breakable
I was taught that life has no regrets and no mistakes, no no
Bet I made some, granted
But my heart cold bruh, definitely definitely granite
Wrote this song halfway to Chicago
Wondering if I should call you
What, to make you feel special?
Would it give me reasons to forget you?
(Hey, you reached Lizzo. Leave me a message..)
I'm out of state, out of time
You more like out of sight, out of mind

Yeah! You know what though?

Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
Rumors going round, got to clear out of town
Smell like a dry fishbone
Here come the law, going to break down the door
Carry me away once more
Never, never, never want it anymore
Got to get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon
And she is playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know

Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet
Fully loaded Tommy gun
Here come the deputy, try fucking getting me
Gotta fucking get up and run
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice
They are going to put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell

I wish I could eat the salt off of your lost faded lips
We can cap the old times, make playing only logical harm
We can cap the old lines, make playing that nothing else will change

But she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad
She can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad
Oh, she's bad

But it's different now that I'm poor and aging

So sweet, so beautiful
Everyday like a queen on her throne
Don't nobody knows how she feels
Aicha, Lady one day it will be real
She moves, she moves like a breeze
I swear I can't get her out of my dreams
To have her shining right here by my side
I'd sacrifice all them tears in my eyes

Aicha Aicha - my my my

Makes her feel like she is blessed from above
Falls asleep underneath her sweet tears
Her lullaby fades away with his fears

Ayo, put one up for the Phifer, long time no hear from
Suckers walkin' around talking about they could get some
But that vibe is non cypher, no can do
And if you take I fi' joke, then ask the other two
And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just seckle with the hoe
Oops...my mistake, I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of all the kids that done hit her?
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter
Heard she likes the two-on-one like my man John Ritter
But back to the subject, you can't catch wreck
You must get respect, to earn respect
Suckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now I wear specs
You're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't Flex
I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable
You think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable!
Yeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me
I’m not a man called Hawk, but I ain’t Mr. Softee
Rappin' is an art, coming straight from the heart
So forget the chart because the action can start

Ha...where ya at? To all my peoples with the funk
I'm the undercover brother, dump your hoe in the trunk
Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
Niggas step back, it's the lyrical worker
The poems that I create ain't in paperback books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
My mental is excelling 'cause I dabble in the books
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops
Yo, I gets the pickin's, I'm such a damn Dickens
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
To me, your just another MC on the log
A link in the chain, fluid on the brain
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane
See, I can't maintain, especially if you come back
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, I could do that
I could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
'Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones
It's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind
Make me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
My title is rock, the Abstract Poetic
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
So smooth and debonair, special for the ear
Gotta keep my thing in gear
'Cause it's evident and clear that I will rock, rock, rock...

Yup yup yup
To the North to the South to the East to the West
I don't discriminate boy I bring it to your chest
If you oppose, then your soul will decompose
Strive to get money and I'm not no hoe
Fresher than the air that you're breathing through your nose
Iller than the kicks that you're puttin on your toes
You can ask Bo but yo that nigga don't know
About the dominant factor, the accurate rapper
Here's the next chapter, page ninety-five
Niggas so hard it's a wonder they alive
But yo we still survive through the danger that lurks
My eyes remain wide while you ass like Urk
And yo my Family Matters, so all you mad hatters
Put your thinking caps on and motherfuckin brainstorm
'Cause I got the plan that wins and can't lose
Your man knows who's nice, say Tip, he'll say ""True""
A lot of these jokers out here is blasé
I'll be rockin mikes until a horse says 'hey'
Some are preoccupied with glamour and glitz
Actin all bougie and making big movies
But I'll be in the cut, call me Incognito
Busy making joints that will bump for my people
You're listening to a man who was something from nothing
Stay in me forever head, never be frontin'

Once in a while we have fun in the mix
Into good living but some be into glitz
Everybody knew, all the fellas and the chicks
We gotta wear a shoe that fits
C'mon word, check it out now 
Uh, uh, check it out now 
What? Uh, check it out now 
 Uh, check it out, yo

Peace to the girl named Hurricane G
Peace to my girl named Dawn Paris
Peace to the Organized Kon-fus-ion
Peace to all my shorties who be dying too young
Peace to both coasts and the land in between
Peace to your man if you're doing your thing
Peace to my peoples who is incarcerated
Asalaam alaikum means peace, don't debate it
Devouring, and towering over fools
Your mic is broke and my shit's cool
The black man with the understanding of
The three wise men and the theories of Zen
Yo, I get inside the crevice like a dentist
Disrupt, the block, like Dennis, the Menace
Shaheed is on the needle, the shit it won't weeble
Or wobble, your rhymes is mixed up like Boggle
Bingo! That was the damn dog's name
But yo I know another one with much more fame
The Phife Dawg, and that's my word to the cipher
About to bring it to your chest and 'cause strife, check it out
You're doubling back to your rhyming pad
What I represent is MC's gone mad
In a perfect world there's imperfect acts
We've come like a guide to redirect alla that
So people with a gift can just flaunt and get money
So much, we in the bank that the shit ain't funny
Money is invested in real estate and stocks
But not inside the glamour 'cause all of that stops

Yo, this the Cons to the Quence
Up in ya like a stiff one, nah'mean?
It's nine-five, you got to live it or rip it
So if you step on the streets keep it movin, nah'mean?

Check my style out
Life situations are the ones I speak about
It seems cats nowadays be gettin' introduced to courage
Don't get discouraged 'cause my words are fluid like flourish
We got the bounty, we from the Queens county
Overlookin' things like a Rushmore Mounty
And got no other choice except to get a little love
We rise above, the beat be fittin' like a glove
The pain in my heart is getting dosed by joy
We have no other ploy but to bring the B-boy
There's nothing on this Earth that can instill fear
The locomotive, puttin' my thing in gear
I only have the fear of God and that's taqwa
You need Binaca; your trap is blazing like Blanka
I got the lethal, you couldn't put a match to it
Let me know, yo, where we could do it like Stuart
Mind over matter, action is needed
When the big one not to be superseded
Responsibility is somethin' I can't deny
The illegalties is the nonsense reply
Most cats who scramble do so because they want to
But known to kick rhymes in the past on impromptu
My willy's hot like two links in the skillet
A room filled with speakers, one stage, watch me kill it
Knowledge should be sought from the cradle to the grave
Rhyming opposition get it twist like Super Dave
You be looking bug just like Uncle Jesse
Don't make the scene messy
'Cause it'll jump, that's word to Aunt Bessie
Profound sentences of pure lyric gems
Some of my friends be liking people with stems
Folks be on the chase for this cheddar
Thinkin' it makes your life better
But it can make you ass out
And when I'm at a show chicks never pass out
We got the joints to make the whole Mash Out out
A Tribe Called Quest make the party go down
Plus we bring positive vibes to fill up all your crowns
Lyrics comes to cats like a hot and cold flash
Some can come with ease, therefore, it's in a smash
Held the fort down like the Justice League hall of Super Friends
But in the world turmoil spins
Brothers walk the street with the ill pace face
City life breeds contempt for each race
All praises due to Allah and I should say it
It's The Abstract motivator making things clear
Puttin' things in perspective to rock and roll
'Cause you know this kid has got wild soul
Americana makes drama like starved-out piranha
Cold like ice, jet hot like a sauna
It's the haves verse the have-not
And guess who's arrived in the hood
Exposing all wrongs, it's all good
Ayo, word up, hip-hop is live like a wire
Let's get a little bit before the whole joint expire
I got to stress it again, this here is for my kin
And all my babies, children of the world, no maybe's
So, yo, we gotta move through and push through
Because we gotta make it happen, keep it true blue
It's like that
So much confusion goin' on
So much confusion goin' on
Inside all mine

So much confusion goin' on
Uh, uh, uh, uh
But everything will be fine

Yo.. Yeah
Nowhere to run to nowhere to hide
Sittin' on the front stoop right outside
In the moonlight when I take flight I fly
Crank the engine, then I break out like I'm benchin'
Thousands of pounds spit thousands of rounds
And verses help 'em out like a found missin' person
This time I'mma try to lounge on the cursin'
So people can hear how my rap sound perfect
Could hate a nigga but in fact it's not worth it
Never know how long you've got on this earth kid
Count them blesses and pay them dues
Keep rollin' with the winners cause they don't lose
In the two G-era the skies is looking clearer
And nothing can stop them guys that's in the mirror
So thankful that I keep my hands on the bankroll
Can't play the shit wreck, falling of the plankroll
So I stay stable like a natural born hustler
Kickin' that hot shit right for all the customers
Near or far comin' here to star
I'll be pourin' out beer in the park
For my loved ones
Deep and thick is how my love runs for you
So with no further ado
I'mma smash it kick that shit they call acid
24 hours a day remain classic

I arise from my melinence to the sun beginning
Kiss by the ray of a sunny day
But I feel it in my bone, a child's without a home
A prison cell holds a dream to a black teen
I never thought I'd see the day when brothers pledge allegiance
To a red white and blue that's wavin' untrue
Yo, where's the forty acres and the mule, huh?
You rather give us Mickey D's and a tool, huh?
And in the sun I see the way you pull our hearts' strings
And in the sun I see your old way to new things
Every man has to bow down to God's grace
Every soul has to concede to God's goal
Politicians get religious to a starved people
As the constitution reads, it says I'm not equal
Three fifths of the gifts from a love supreme
This gotta be a bad dream, I'm hearing trains scream
Little kids are getting warped from computer thoughts
Family structure is destroyed, marriage null and void
All has gotten formulated, really hate to say it
But I can see it easy, really, in the sun
 without LP

Yo don't ever think I've forgotten
Them days black plottin'
And schemin'
Sittin' in the lunchroom
Eatin' and dreamin'
On about the things we do
When we reach independence
Nothing is brand new
It's all still accordin' to plan
Meet your man
From decades ago can't nobody understand
The hardships we've been through
Sun to sun
On the wake up knock knock
Everybody gotta run for the ultimate goal
Can't lose they soul
In the process
So and to you I say God bless
Seeing your face lets me see my own
So I zone, and think about the days we got stoned
In the staircase of apartment buildings
Little childrens
Growing in a world so cold
Just like pilgrims, we migrate daily
Now a days we rarely get to see one another
But when we connect we still brothers
And now we in the corporate world
And the game is different
You get caught up in the twirl
If your fam ain't affective
So here's our perspective
To help each other
Cause man ain't it hectic
 to fade

Tú, tú eres lo que yo escogí
Yo quiero perderme en ti
Yo quiero darte todo
Yo quiero darte mi love

Y para que comprendas todo lo que significa
Yo te hice esta canción
Yo te hice un poema en un verso
Yo te voy a escribir todas las noches un cuento
Niño, yo soy tu princesa, tu cara de muñeca
¿Sabes lo que más me gusta de ti?
Es tu love

Me gustas de los pies a la cabeza
Me encanta que te guste las sorpresas, love
Me gusta mirarte, me encanta tocarte
Me mata la manera en que me besas, love
De los pies a la cabeza
Yo quiero hacerte arriba de una mesa el love
Me gusta tu olor, me encanta tu love
Tú y yo somos puro love

Tú y yo somos puro love, uoh
Tú y yo somos puro love, uoh

Yo, yo seré de ti tu perdición
Quizás tu serás de mí, mi bendición
Y cuando yo te veo caminar, cuando te veo así
Con esta carita de constelación
Pareces la luna que se vuelve loca por un beso
Y por decirle a las estrellas  que es love
Para enamorarnos, bastan dos segundos
Um par de miradas, un beso en la boca, te saco la ropa

Me gustas de los pies a la cabeza
Me encanta que te guste las sorpresas, love
Me gusta mirarte, me encanta tocarte
Me mata la manera en que me besas, love
De los pies a la cabeza
Yo quiero hacerte arriba de una mesa el love
Me gusta tu olor, me encanta tu love

Ven y vamo' a cambiar el planeta
Hoy vamo' a hacer el love en una mesa
Vamo' a hacer canciones
Algo de emociones
Vamo' a ser sincero
Vamo' a hablar la neta
A mí me gusta el love contigo
A mí me gusta bailar contigo
A mí me gustas tú, me gustas tú
Me gusta tocártelo
Si tiene sentido lo que yo te digo
Vamo' a pasarlo bien los dos
Si quieres te pido que vivas conmigo
Y nos vamo' pa' hacer el love

아직 잊지 못하고 아주 달콤히 맴돌아
나 꿈인 줄 모르고 star 헤매이고 있어
그냥 어지러운 가봐요
잠이 든 그댄 아무 말도 말아요
이미 익숙해진 우리 미로 사이

참을 수 없어 Have a feel so sweet
어색했던 우리 첫 와인처럼
쓰고 아프지만 두 눈에 가득 담아
흐르는 대로 널 보내줄게

나 너에게 취해 난 이 밤에 취해
니가 모질게 했던 그 기억 속에
그 추억에 헤매 널 찾고 있어
그냥 잊을래 너의 맘도 알고 싶어 boy
그냥 잊어줘 Baby please don’t go

나 바빠 Bae 아니야 그만 잡아 Phone
우리 얘기 다 끝났어 난 차가운 남자라고
누가 취하면 그런 거 못해 잡다 놓다가 새 Phone에
지문 묻히기 누가 못하냐고
알아 난 나이 24 이별 따위엔 서툴지
사실 이제 나 익숙해졌음 해
마치 또래보다 훨씬 많은 돈을 버는 일
허나 나보다 훨씬 여리디 여린 널 위해
다 큰 어른인 척 좀 할 수 밖에 없는걸 생각해 좀좀좀

지울 수 없어 Have a feel so sweet
익숙해져 버린 네 향기처럼
쓰고 아프지만 내 맘에 가득 담아
흐르는 대로 널 보내줄게

나 너에게 취해 난 이 밤에 취해
니가 모질게 했던 그 기억 속에
그 추억에 헤매 널 찾고 있어
그냥 잊을래 너의 맘도 알고 싶어 boy
그냥 잊어줘 Baby please don’t go

눈 감으면 맴돌아 너와 걷던 길
함께한 시간 이대로 잠들면 oh
오늘 좀 취한 것 같아
잠긴 목소리로 불러도
넌 아무렇지 않게 가줘

나 너에게 취해 난 이 밤에 취해

There's nothing like the joy you bring

Seems like the moment has come and I'm gonna get you girl
The shadows are forming across your parts, the vision looks absurd
No one around to interrupt the feelings you stir

Imagine if it was, if this was you, if this wasn't
So perfectly designed
To be here all night
Let the world rage outside
Cause, when I'm here with you, the world stops for me
The world stops for me

And then extraordinary, ordinary things
Things I can't explain with subtext, the world stops for me
And girl you know just what I mean
I, I need you, girl
Sing me a song
Sing it soft, sing it long
Girl stop my world

Once I was 7 years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was 7 years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By 11, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was 11 years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old

I've always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I truly love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me ,at least those in favour
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've travelled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Esta es mi canción de despedida será lo mejor para los dos
Pues no soy el dueño de tu vida y lo mas grave no se porque no lo entiende el corazón
Dime como hago para explicarle a mi alma envuelta entre la fe
Que aunque sea difícil olvidarte debo intentarlo porque creo que nunca te podré tener
Si no deseas que me marche demuestra que al igual que yo quieres amarme
Y que también te estas muriendo por besarme
Y así yo intentare esperarte hasta que tu decidas entregarte
A este hombre que ha hecho todo para enamorarte
Porque estoy enloqueciendo y tengo todo de cabeza
Te voy a seguir queriendo aunque tu no te des cuenta
Que el maldito sufrimiento es quien causa mis tristezas
Y de paso a mi conquista le va quitando la fuerza
Que no puedo darte el mundo para nadie es un secreto
Yo tan solo te aseguro que serás mi amor eterno
Quien controle mi futuro y me saque de este infierno
Donde lo bello y lo puro se destruye con el tiempo
Humillado frente a la esperanza de rodillas le pido el favor
Que me ayude a ganar tu confianza y a enamorarte para no seguir atado a una ilusión
Te llevo enredada entre mis sueños mi forma de hablar y mi pensar
Por eso vivir sin ti no puedo y en mi recuerdo tu nombre por siempre permanecerá
Ignoras lo que por ti siento por eso sigo huyéndole a un tormento
Que quiere que sea esclavo de el por mucho tiempo
Te haré una casa entre los cielos y hasta vecinos de Ada luz seremos
Y cada ves que tu lo quieras bajaremos
Porque estoy enloqueciendo y tengo todo de cabeza
Te voy a seguir queriendo aunque tu no te des cuenta
Que el maldito sufrimiento es quien causa mis tristezas
Y de paso a mi conquista le va quitando la fuerza
Que no puedo darte el mundo para nadie es un secreto
Yo tan solo te aseguro que serás mi amor eterno

Randbezirk und keine Aussicht auf Jobs
'N weinendes Kind und 'ne Mum, die nicht kocht

Alle Mittelfinger hoch für die Banken und Snobs
Und jeden Cop in Hugo Boss ausm zwanzigsten Stock
Verschanzt in ihr'm Schloss
Gepanzerte Scheiben aus Angst vor ihr'm Gott (tru)

Meine Zeit is' jetzt
Egal was kommt, man, ich bleib' relaxt
Ich lehn' mich zurück, schreib 'n Text
Noch keinen Plan wohin, doch bis jetzt war's fett, uh yeah

Ich spring in die Tight Jeans, White Tees, schlüpf in die Nikes
Spike Lees, bring' dich zurück in die Nineties ""Hi Kids""
Ich bin nicht verrückt, doch'n Hypebeast
Like dies, like das, like alles, kein Beef
Kein G, kein Weed, kein Feat, mein Beat (oh yeah)
Fat Banger, bitte mach die Tracks länger
Doch ich mach, was ich will, außer das Rezept ändern
Hmmm, schmeckt lecker, bin kein Jetsetter
Doch meine Tracks geh'n um die Welt - Backpacker
Und deine Freundin heißt Ecca
Will ja nich' meckern, doch sie sitzt auf meinem Sweater
Und sie schluckt nach ihrem Doppelwhopper nochmal locker
23 Kühe und'n halbes Dutzend Trecker
Was so viel heißt, wie deine Olle is' schweeer
In Ordnung, denn man kann sie roll'n, wie das ""R"", yeah
Meine Chick ist scharf, wie das ""S""
Ja genau, sie ist scharf wie ein Mex-
Ikaner, Lieblingsfilm, sie will mich wiederseh'n
Doch ich brauch nicht viel im Leben außer das ""Supreme-Emblem""
Auf meinen Snapbacks, Decks oder Backpacks
Jede Zeile ist fett und relaxt so wie Jack Black
Ich denk zurück als das Rap-Ding begann
Damals waren meine Helden Max, Sam und Jan
Heute zieh ich selber mit den Tracks übers Land
Bin egal, wohin ich komm', schon bekannt - Sing es!
 (2x)

Oh oh oh yeah, yippie yeah
Sollte alles klappen, bin ich bald Milliardär
Haha, war'n Witz, ich mein Millionär
Und was ich damit meine? Meine Taschen sind - leer
Ist okay, man, ich brauch' kein Cash
Brauch keine Villa am Meer und auch kein Benz
Brauch keine eigene Band, brauch keine Brand
Alles, was ich von euch will, ist ein ""Oh yeah""
Und du sagst ""Uuh, die Beats sind tight""
Also steckst sie in die Pipe und ziehs sie rein
Nimm dir 2 Minuten Zeit, atme kurz tief ein
Und du merkst, du wirst high, willst mehr von dem Scheiß
Also lehn dich zurück, mach das Fenster auf
Tape rein, aufdreh'n, Gänsehaut
Jap, denn ich hab', was ein Gangster braucht
Schreiben andere Rapper Texte, hab ich längst gebounced

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby bitte komm und lass uns chillen
Ich will heute weder aufstehen, noch will ich hier raus gehen
Denn da draußen gibt es niemanden, der uns beide missen würde
Du und ich allein in deiner kleinen Bude immer noch im Bett und chillen
Also komm Baby geh nicht weg und bleib liegen
Wenn ich sage du bist immer noch das Allerbeste was mir je passiert ist, na dann ist das untertrieben
Denn mit dir im Bett ist die Welt wieder wie perfekt
Und kein Plan wie das ohne dich ging denn so lange du hier bist will ich nie wieder weg
Ja und ich weiß du willst das nicht hören aber Baby du bist wunderschön
Manchmal wünsch ich mir du würdest deine Zeit in meinem Kopf verbringen und die Welt aus meinen Augen sehen
Du wärst das Schönste was du sehen würdest
Und wir machen ein Paar Dinge die man Mama nicht erzählen würde
Siehst mich an, machst das Licht aus, ziehst mich an und ich dich aus
Und ich bin so was von addicted, denn jedes Mal wenn du mich mit ‘nem Blick triffst
Steht meine Welt kurz still, es ist wie im Film
Bitte lass uns chillen

Yeah, Baby, mit dir bleibt die Zeit stehen
Es fühlt sich an als wär das hier für
Immer, immer, immer, immer, immer
Yeah, Baby, mit dir bleibt die Zeit stehen
Es fühlt sich an als wär das hier für
Immer, immer, immer, immer, immer

Immer wo wir liegen
Fühlt es sich so an, als wäre ich federleicht und könnte fliegen
Wir sind weit, weit weg über Wolke 7 (tausend)
Und wenn ich Bock hab könnte ich dir auf der Stelle sofort über hundert Dinge nennen wieso du das Allerbeste dieser Welt bist
Würdest du mir nicht immer den Mund verbieten
Und deshalb sag ich nichts, blind verstehen
Doch das hat ne ganze Weile lang gedauert weißt du manche Dinge kann man halt als Kind nicht sehen
So wie Sterne am Tag und immer wieder merk ich, wie selten ich sag, wie sehr ich dich mag
Deine ehrliche Art und es wird immer mehr seit dem ersten Tag
Und ja ich weiß, es ist nicht immer leicht und wir beide haben leider hin und wieder Streit
Es tut mir leid, bitte bleib, Baby
Denn dieser Moment ist so perfekt ich lass dich nie wieder alleine
Jeder von uns beiden weiß, das Leben ist so schnell vorbei und deshalb lass uns doch so tun als hätten wir für immer Zeit doch irgendwann alles wieder so…

Yeah, Baby, mit dir bleibt die Zeit stehen
Es fühlt sich an als wär das hier für

Me and Magdalena
We're driving south through Monterey
As the sun is slowly sinking
Into a distant ocean wave

And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she's under

Tell me Magdalena
What do you see in the depths of your night?
Do you see a long lost father?
Does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child?

But know everything lost will be recovered
When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered
And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she's under

Me and Magdalena
Always leaving early and sleeping late
Secluded in the canyon
Lost within a turn of fate

But know everything lost will be recovered
When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered
And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she's under

Forgive the kids
For they don't know how to live
Run the alleys, casually

Cruel, cruel

Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?

They could take or leave you
So they took you and they left you
How could they be casually

Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh

Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?

You were the one waving flares in the air
So they could see you
And they were the zephyr blowing past you
Blowing fastly so they can’t see you

Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

And all I do is sit and think about you

It's not living if it's not with you

And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation

Letra de Volví A Nacer (Live from Spotify)
Puedo no roncar por las mañana
Puedo trabajar de sol a sol
Puedo subirme hasta el Himalaya
O batirme con mi espada
Para no perder tu amor
Puedo ser, tu fiel, chófer, mujer
Todo lo que te imaginas puedo ser
Y es que por tu amor volvía a nacer
Tu fuiste la respiración
Y era tan grande la ilusión
Pero si te vas que voy a hacer
Planchar de nuevo el corazón
Se pone triste esta canción
Quiero casarme contigo
Quedarme a tu lado
Ser el bendecido con tu amor
Por eso yo quiero
Dejar mi pasado
Que vengas conmigo
Morirme en tus brazos dulce amor
Por eso yo quiero
Puedo boxear en las olimpiadas
Puedo mendigar por tu perdón
Puedo mudarme a la Castellana
Agua fría por las mañanas
Y alinear en el Unión
Puedo ser, tu fiel, chófer, mujer
Todo lo que te imaginas puedo ser
Y es que por tu amor volvía a nacer
Tu fuiste la respiración
Y era tan grande la ilusión
Pero si te vas que voy a hacer
Planchar de nuevo el corazón
Se pone triste esta canción
Quiero casarme contigo
Quedarme a tu lado
Ser el bendecido con tu amor
Por eso yo quiero
Dejar mi pasado
Que vengas conmigo
Morirme en tus brazos dulce amor
Por eso yo quiero
Quiero casarme contigo
Quedarme a tu lado
Ser el bendecido con tu amor
Por eso yo quiero
Dejar mi pasado
Que vengas conmigo
Morirme en tus brazos dulce amor
Puedo boxear en las olimpiadas
Puedo trabajar de sol a sol
Puedo tantas cosas en mi vida
Por tu amor

Letra de La Foto de Los Dos
Hoy encontré la foto de los dos
Dentro de un corazón
Posando en la estación
Te busque en un viejo tocadiscos
Y aquella canción que tanto te gustaba
Hoy la nostalgia me apretuja el alma
Hoy los fantasmas de tu amor me llaman
Hoy te quiero contar
Porque nunca te pude olvidar
Y recuerdo que tu amor conmigo
No sabia distancias
Y los besos que tanto nos dimos
Fueron como el agua
Y la luz que trajo a nuestras vidas
Y alumbro la casa
Que era nuestra casa
Hoy quisiera devolver el tiempo
Para no dejarla
Regresar a mi pueblo
Por el camino viejo
Y recoger mis pasos
Y empezar de nuevo
Y empezar de nuevo
Regresar a la casa
Como regresa el viento
Volver a abrazarte
Y empezar de nuevo
Y empezar de nuevo
Hoy rebusque de nuevo el corazón
Y me encontré tu amor
Sentado en el sillón
Recordé la sal de tu dolor
La tarde que al adiós
Llorando nos amamos
Hoy la nostalgia me apretuja el alma
Hoy los fantasmas de tu amor me llaman
Hoy te quiero contar
Porque nunca te pude olvidar
Y recuerdo que tu amor conmigo
No sabia distancias
Y los besos que tanto nos dimos
Fueron como el agua
Y la luz que trajo a nuestras vidas
Y alumbro la casa
Que era nuestra casa
Hoy quisiera devolver el tiempo
Para no dejarla
Regresar a mi pueblo
Por el camino viejo
Y recoger mis pasos
Y empezar de nuevo
Y empezar de nuevo
Regresar a la casa
Como regresa el viento
Volver a abrazarte
Y empezar de nuevo
Y empezar de nuevo
Regresar a mi pueblo
Por el camino viejo
Y recoger mis pasos
Y empezar de nuevo
Y empezar de nuevo
Regresar a la casa
Como regresa el viento
Volver a abrazarte
Y empezar de nuevo
Y empezar de nuevo
Empezar de nuevo
Empezar de nuevo

Tengo por dentro un medidor
Que va marcando grados de satisfacción
No necesito su aprobación
Que me censuren tiene su bemol
Pero mi metro va por dentro
Porque tengo mi propia versión
Veo que la cosa no es color de rosa
Y mientras vibran mis cuerdas
Todo me huele a que se pudrió
No necesito su aprobación
Ni el vil metal con que me tientan
Tampoco busco su comprensión
Ni endulzarles la oreja
Aislada en una burbuja
Leo entre líneas
Que nada va a estar mejor
Y desde mi casa en el aire

Wasting on nothing
Effortlessly, you appear
Sound of the thunder
Reverberate in your ears

This is the chance to transform
Pause for the silence
Inhabit the calm of the storm

This is the notion, your ocean of night

Love is a feeling
Buried with me in the yard
Gaze at the skyline
Under the ocean of stars
This is your slow dance
And this is your chance to transform
Lost to a moment
The moment you confront the storm

Girl where did you come from? Got me so undone
Gaze in your eyes got me saying
""What a beautiful lady"", no if's, and's or maybes
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing
There's no one else that matters, you love me
And I won't let you fall, girl, let you fall, girl
I won't let you fall, let you fall, let you fall

Whatever you want, I got it, Papi
Don't hesitate, holla at me!
What I'm lookin' for
Is simple, you see
Love and support and sexuality
When I'm with you, I don't wanna leave
I need you just like air that I breathe
But when I'm not with you, I'm missing my peace
I got a lot inside I need to release

You fulfill my every desire
When I'm with you, you take me higher (Wooo woo whoo)

There is no way you are gettin' away
I need your love every day
Medicine can't cure the way that I feel
What I need is my inner fill
Being without you, its makin me ill
Stressin me out I need to chill
Something this strong, gotta be real
Nothing or no one, show my skills

You fulfill my every desire
When I'm with you, you take me higher (Wooo woo whoo)

I can't seem to find a way to escape how I feel (how i feel)
I can't wait no longer

Ain't there something I can give you
In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind and make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out
Of reach
The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea
We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes I tell you now, that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, honey
Everybody's got opinions
'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again
We love so strong and so unselfishly
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, baby
They don't bother me, said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, listen baby
Somebody understands me
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long
Always on my own, now I'm home
My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone, I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever
We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I made a vow so I tell you now
I'm giving you the best that I got, listen baby
I bet everything on my wedding ring
I'm giving you the best that I got
Givin' it to you baby

Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor?
I don't know how you feel can you tell me?
I won't know how you feel 'til you tell me
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?

Is it cause I'm a star
It maybe could be my star status
I got my chain and ring
My Rolex watch it got 50 carats
It could be QC or even maybe it's me
It could be that 4 hour flight, shopping in Beverly
What's on your mind? I'm not Ginuwine
Ain't tryna spend no time
I know my bitch she so fine
But I don't know what's on her mind
Gotta pay that cost to be a boss

The junkies they hit it, they scratchin' and itchin'
The flow that we killin', the flow that we spittin'
My nigga you know we invented it
Dripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic
I'm a Migo but my bitch an immigrant
I got the boot but no Timberland
I am the plug, you the middle man
I never leave my niggas starvin'
You niggas mistake me for Marvin
I got 15 bricks I'm finna drop
In there right next to that carbine

Is it my looks or is it my wealth?
Or is it the way that I carry myself?
Let me know I need some help
Don't keep that secret to yourself
Bitches be saying I'm acting funny cause a young nigga got a lotta money
She lookin' at me like she want somethin'
Can't give her nothin' but a couple hundreds
She sucked up on a nigga, tryna give a nigga kisses, baby girl you trippin'

Everybody needs an anchor
A little something that makes you stay
An incentive, someone to fight for
Cause no one really needs so much space
A couple years ago I was lonely
I used to think that there was no God
But then you looked at me with your blue eyes
And my agnosticism turned into dust

How well you know me
That I don’t care if the rest don’t
It doesn’t matter to me, no ohh
Oh-oh-oh and as long as you love me
As long as we still have each other

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23
Pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa
Ahh- ahh

God knows that I’m a good dancer
My feet can move to the music he plays
But there were times I asked for an answer
When he was acting in mysterious ways
There were nights that I stayed up crying
Cause I was certain that things wouldn't change
But then you came and I saw you smiling
Just like an angel, so beautifully strange

And then you touched me
It's like you were made for me, oh-oh
Like it was all meant to be, oh-oh
And I was sure that you would love me
And that we'd always have each other

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23
Pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa
Ohh- ohh

Always thought that I was fine but I was wrong
It was you, that one piece I was missing
And I could do without you but, it'd be no fun
I found you and life was suddenly easy
There ain't no worries now
There ain't no feeling down

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23

Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With awkward situations, empty conversations

Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

So, this is where the story ends
A conversation on I.M
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With texting sorry for the miscommunication

And I can't find the other half

Next time I see you
I'm giving you a high five
'Cause hugs are overrated, just FYI

봐봐 나를 봐봐
똑바로 내 두눈을 봐
거봐 이미 너는
딴 곳을 보고 있어
Check it, 1, 2, 3
시계바늘만 쳐다보는게
말 안해도 다른 사람 생긴걸 알아

요즘 넌 나 아닌 다른 사람과 만남이 잦더라
이제는 먼저 전화도 걸지 않더라
나랑 있을 때는 하루가 일초라도
넌 내 앞에선 요즘
하늘만 보더라
Oh, I know your mind
이미 너와
나의 거리
멀어진
그리고 벌어진
남보다 못한 우리 사이

우리 오래전 나눴던
꿈과 빛을 쏘았던
그 날의 웃음 함께란 이유로
힘이 되었던 지난날을 기억해
So open your eyes
저 높은 곳을 바라봐
늘 곁에 있는 모두가
끝까지 함께 있어
멈추지 않아도 돼
Can you feel it in the air
너에게 더 집중해
눈을 떠 Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Higher and Higher
Right into the air
숨을 쉬어 갈 뿐이야 눈을 떠
Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
눈을 감아봐 내 손을 잡고 fly
우릴 믿고 다 이 느낌대로 가
편한 마음 it’s okay
꿈을 위한 삶 all day
길을 잃었던 생각이 들 땐
맘껏 울어도 좋은 것 같아
깨끗이 씻겨진 길이 드러나
다시 걷게 될 거야
So open your eyes
저 높은 곳을 바라봐
늘 곁에 있는 모두가 끝까지
함께 있어 멈추지 않아도 돼
Can you feel it in the air
너에게 더 집중해
눈을 떠 Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Higher and Higher
Right into the air
숨을 쉬어 갈 뿐이야 눈을 떠
Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Back to the basic
Hot 하대 최신이
거슬러 보면 classic
한입 갖고 두말 안 해 지켜냈지
I kept it I keep my promise
변함없는 가치
비싼 명품백 다 가질 것만 같지
아무도 함부로 가지 못한 곳
맘속으로만 생각하고 원한 곳
끝이 어딘 줄 아냐고
물음 대답은 No
대신 We can give it to you
더욱 새로운 것
Ah
널 바라보고 있어
난 언제든 곁에 있어
Take my hands
Can you feel it in the air
너에게 더 집중해
눈을 떠 Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Higher and Higher
Right into the air
숨을 쉬어 갈 뿐이야 눈을 떠
Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Ah
Right into the air

Pa' las que son más zorras que los cazadores
Pa' las mujeres que no apagan sus motores

Marco se n'è andato e non ritorna più
E il treno delle 7:30 senza lui
È un cuore di metallo senza l'anima
Nel freddo del mattino grigio di città
A scuola il banco è vuoto, Marco è dentro me
È dolce il suo respiro fra i pensieri miei
Distanze enormi sembrano dividerci
Ma il cuore batte forte dentro me

Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con i tuoi non parli mai
Se ti nascondi come me
Sfuggi gli sguardi e te ne stai
Rinchiuso in camera e non vuoi mangiare
Stringi forte a te il cuscino
Piangi e non lo sai quanto altro male ti farà la solitudine

Marco nel mio diario ho una fotografia
Hai gli occhi di bambino un poco timido
La stringo forte al cuore e sento che ci sei
Fra I compiti d'inglese e matematica
Tuo padre e i suoi consigli che monotonia
Lui con il suo lavoro ti ha portato via
Di certo il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai
Ha detto ""un giorno tu mi capirai""

Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con gli amici parlerai
Per non soffrire più per me
Ma non è facile lo sai
A scuola non ne posso più
E I pomeriggi senza te
Studiare è inutile tutte le idee si affollano su te
Non è possibile dividere la vita di noi due
Ti prego aspettami amore mio...
Ma illuderti non so!

La solitudine fra noi
Questo silenzio dentro me
E l'inquietudine di vivere la vita senza te
Ti prego aspettami perché
Non posso stare senza te
Non è possibile dividere la storia di noi due
La solitudine fra noi
Questo silenzio dentro me
E l'inquietudine di vivere la vita senza te
Ti prego aspettami perché
Non posso stare senza te

Me arrepiento tanto de haberte dicho adiós

Se prende en la pista bailando conmigo
El aroma, se toca, me mira
Y yo electrónicamente encendido
No me atrevo, oh-oh a decirle na'a
Me hago el duro pidiendo una copa
Sentado en la barra del bar (ah)
Me acerco a su lado, le juego el pelo
Le canto cancione' al oído
Tu quisiera' una cita conmigo
Te sigo en el Twitter, si quiere' te escribo
De repente tra-tra, llegó su novio ya
Si no la va' a cuidar echate pa' atrá'-trá

Subete La Makina...
No quisiera aceptar lo que en
Esta noche me ha pasado
Tanto amor tanto cariño
Tenia para ti
Solo uninstante que me ilusion
Por ti dañaste sin querer...
Un raro vacio llena mi corazon
Al saber que no te tuve y te perdi
Que triste es enamorarse
De quien no te quiere
Muchos sueños junto contigo
Se realizar
Y hoy te digo que te amo...
Me dices:
Perdoname, perdoname... Yo no te quiero
Pues mi corazon es de otro
Perdoname, perdoname... Yo no te quiero
Pues mi corazon es de otro
Estoy sufriendo por ti

En alegría vamo' juntos
A la montaña de mi patria
Dominicana, el acordeón
Tocando fuerte, bien de cierto
Y quiero verte, chocando cuerpo
Mojando la ropa, así se goza
Moviendo la cosa maravillosa
Con mucho swing 'del latin'
Calientita como el ají (?)
Quisqueyana que buena baila usted
Da la vuelta mami otra vez
Llegó el negro de la joya
Fulano de tal, gozadera total

Get out of here con eso
Taíno indio caribeño

Merengueao ripeao pa' su hijo
Levante la mano ???
Bulla hasta el amanecer
Corriente, con mucha corriente
Desorden forma de repente
Aguardiente, Brugal, Presidente
Barceló es lo que bebe la gente
Bailando el weekend gozando
Totalmente, sigan acabando

Francamente yo soy teniente
No puedes verme con par de lentes
Chequea el estilo pegando siempre
Como un martillo saben, aprende de este chin como se hace con mucho swing
Sin pararse la noche entera, sin barreras a tu manera
Haz lo que quieras cántele un coro

Que tu amor se me escurre entre los dedos

Se que aunque te insista no vas a quedarte
Que en tu pecho abrí una herida difícil de sanar
Que estas cansada de promesas
De preguntas sin respuesta
Que hoy se acaba nuestro amor
Que es inevitable este adiós, oh no

Que fui yo
Quien se quedo con el intento de hacerte feliz
Que no fue falta de amor
Que son fracasos y derrotas

Porque te juro me soñé contigo eternamente
Y hoy se muere
Con este adiós mi corazón
Mi fe y mi buena suerte

Porque no falló el amor
Lo que me falto fue suerte
Y tiempo para demostrarte
Que para mi eres lo mas importante

Aunque pongas por delante el corazón
Hoy he perdido un gran amor
Porque el destino no ayudo

Dime si esta noche
Tu te vas de ronda
Como ella se fue
¿con quien esta?
Dile que la quiero
Dile que me muero
De tanto esperar
Que vuelva ya
Que las rondas
No son buenas
Que hacen daño
Que dan pena
Y que acaban
Por llorar
Solamente una vez
Ame en la vida
Solamente una vez
Y nada mas
Una vez nada mas
En mi huerto
Brillo la esperanza
La esperanza que alumbra
El camino de mi soledad
Una vez, nada mas
Se entrega el alma
Con la dulce y total
Renunciación
Y cuando ese milagro
Realiza el prodigio
De amarse
Hay campanas de fiesta que cantan
En el corazón
Mirando torear a Silverio
Me ha salido de mi dentro
Lo gitano de un cantar
Con la garganta sequita
Muy sequita la garganta
Seca de tanto gritar
Silverio, Silverio Perez
Diamante del redondel
Tormento de las mujeres
A ver quien puede con el
Silverio, torero estrella
El príncipe milagro
De la fiesta mas bella
Carmelo que está en el cielo
Se asoma a verte torerar
Monarca del trincherazo
Torero, torerazo
Azteca y Español
Silverio, cuando toreas
No cambio por un trono
Mi barrera de sol

(Intro)
Why can't I find somebody else
When I know, know that you're doing wrong
It's so hard, hard to let go
(Verse 1)
I done went through just about two bags of tissues baby
And you're looking at me like you ain't the issue baby
And though I tried to leave, I can't stop missing you baby
And I keep coming, I keep coming back
(Hook)
I keep going in circles, circles
'Round and 'round
And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what I can I say
But I wanna go
I wanna go but I keep coming back
(Verse 2)
Why I'm so confused for you, I have no answer boy (one time!)
When I feel so used by you just like a toy (two times!)
It's a shame that you don't care enough to even give me half the love I give to you
I live for you baby
I'm ashamed to say that I'm to blame for how you act
Cause I keep coming, I keep coming back
(Hook)
I can't stop
I can't stop
I can't stop missing you baby
I can't stop
(Bridge)
I stay cause I love you but I hate that I stay
You know I won't go that's why you treat me this way
I want to be happy though it hurts me so bad
Don't know what it is that keeps me coming back
Hol' up (wait a minute)
I said hol' up (wait a minute)
I said hol' up (wait a minute)
I said freeze!

In an hour when I wake up
I’mma take a little time and bring up
The fact that we did break up
And just for one night we made up
And we made love, and it was so good
That sweet, rough, that funky stuff
I can tell by your moans, you ain't get enough
Maybe you are, but it ain't my love

Don't be expecting no breakfast in the morning baby
You got all you gon' get, this is it, this is closure
This is closure, this is closure, this is closure, told ya

Now you're looking at me with faces
Cause I went two different places
You're thinking it's a new beginning
When I know that it's the ending
We ended our time for a reason
Our trouble was never pleasing
Each other we got the right seeds done
That ain't enough to plant our dreams in
Oh I want some sugar in my bowl
A deeper connection baby
Don't you want more?
I think it's time that we move forward
I purred like a kitten and you roared
This is the last time I hope you enjoyed
Now would you mind leaving out the back door?

Don't be expecting no breakfast baby
You got all you gon' get, this is it, this is closure
This is closure, this is closure, this is closure, told ya

Look homie, there will be no more homemade waffles, okay? With the fresh strawberries, you know the ones I put the agave in
There will be no more quiche and no more sausages
And don't even think about my pepper jack grits
Or my grandma's buttermilk biscuits. (Told ya)
Hungry?
You want something to eat?
You want some of my time?
You want some of my affection? You want my honesty? You want me to listen to you baby?
Aw, is that what you want from me?
Hah, you better get that backdoor, go on
Hell no (Told Ya)

You don't hear me out here knocking?
That mean don't come...You want me to leave right now? The closure start today?
It's good, I can still come back and wash your car if you need me to
For that breakfast and that guave sweetener, I, no more of that?
And the waffle gone too? I'll come inside so I can hear you. No?

Tengo miedo que el tiempo venga y me coma
Tengo miedo que el viento robe mi voz
Tengo miedo que ellos me vean triste
Es por eso que yo no quiero salir
Tengo miedo que al baño le abran la puerta
Que me vean desnuda y se den la vuelta
Y sí sigo comiendo me suba el peso
Es por eso que yo no quiero salir
Es por eso que yo...

Mami espérame, aléjate de mí
Déjame caerme, déjame salir
Mami espérame, aléjate de mí
Déjame caerme, déjame salir

Tengo miedo de noche, que alguien me robe
Que se queme la casa o haya fantasmas
Escribir más cartas, perder palabras
Y es por eso que yo no quiero salir
Tengo miedo de un día perder mis dedos
No tener mas amigos que rían conmigo
Resbalar en el hielo, caer al río

Escúchate esto

Justo cuando yo me confié
Y una vida entera imaginé
Justo cuando yo cerré los ojos y salté
Sin saber lo que venía después
Justo cuando yo bajé la guardia
Cuando vi una luz en nuestra historia
Justo cuando quise añadirle el para siempre
Tú te fuiste, así tan de repente

Con mi amor atado entre tus manos
Con mis sueños todos enredados
Con mi amor tan lejos de tus labios, oh-ooh
Justo cuando yo me enamoré
Te fuiste y no sé por qué (Escúchate esto)

No sé si te habrá ganado el miedo
O es que para ti fui solo un juego
Todos mis amigos me decían
Ten cuidado, mírate
Estás muy entregado
Oh, mírame
Como me has dejado

Con mis sueños todos enredados
Con mi amor tan lejos de tus labios, oh-oh-oh

Pensé que había quedado claro
Yo no soy para ti, tú te ibas a ir
Vete de aquí, no entiendo que estás buscando
De que me estás hablando, si hace poco decías que ya no sentías nada por mí

That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on
And if I don't let you know
Then I won't be for real
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you the more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me it's only you

I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter what time of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact than I'll be more than you ever could dream of
If all you need is the time that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you call baby
I wanna stay by your side
Be there to call you up
And let you know everything will be all right

I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you

I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have super powers
Rap 225 thousand hours
Get it calculated, do the math
I made 1,000 songs that made you move your ass
And for the last 300 months
I made 16 albums with me on the front and they bump
Where you get your beats?
I heard 93 rappers say bitch like me
2 singers and 10 comedians
And I'm still gon' yell it every time you see me in
What's my favorite word?
BITCH!
Why they gotta say it like $hort?
BITCH!
You know they can't play on my court
Can't hang with the big dogs
Stay on the porch

Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle

Where you get that from?
Grab the mic, spit one, let me hit that blunt
Pimp-C, 8-Ball, and MJG
Keep spittin' that P to the I-M-P

Ball and G, that's Memphis, baby

Ain't nothin' but pimpin' these days, G
My nigga C got locked up
But these real hoes still know they gots to fuck
Give a fuck nigga what you say

Pretty girls in the VIP
They came with Dre... they don't need ID

Your mind is gone
Your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last 3 days
Poppin' pills
It goes down for real
Don't stop, just keep rollin' down hill
Crash and burn, can't stand, fall back
You're doin' too much, you can't handle all that
Man, it's been way too long
Time to let the whole world play your songs
Like me, my shit gets around
Leave the country, come back, and hit The Town
I'm in Miami, New York, and ATL
Houston and LA, ask Dave Chappelle about my rich bitch
He got it from me
And made 50 million dollars
I'm proud of you D
But I'm crazy you don't wanna be like me
I come from East Oakland where the youngstas get hyphy

Sie sagt, sie würde gern ans Meer, mal wieder weg von hier
Ist egal wohin, einfach weit weit weg und der Stress bleibt hier
Und am besten gleich sie sagt: ""Man, ich hätt' gern Zeit
Wär nicht gern reich, ich will nur so viel, dass es stressfrei reicht
Ey, verdammt man
Ich wär gern bei ihr
Sie will nach London, Paris, einfach raus in die Welt und smilen, yeah!
Und jeder Club spielt ihr Lieblingslied
Sie will nie wieder heim, yeah

""Was ist mit dir sag hast du'n Wunsch?""
Ich sag: ""Ne, eigentlich ist alles cool!"", denn

Wenn ich dich nicht seh'?
Und jedes Mal, wenn du mich dann ansiehst
Bleibt meine Welt kurz steh'n
Und ich weiß ganz genau, dass du dich grade fragst
Ob das mit uns geht
Denn kaum bin ich da, muss ich weg
Doch versprech dir jetzt, ich bin bald wieder
Da, yeah
Ich bin in London, Paris, man, ich glaub ich bin jetzt ein
Star, yeah
Nein, ich denk nich' nach, sondern mach nur, was ich
Mag, yeah
Denn diese Welt is' geil

Und plötzlich macht dir das Rapding Fun, ist echt entspannt
Denn der Typ macht das, was der Rest nicht kann
Und du bist längst im Bann
Aber wart ma', der Track fängt doch jetzt erst an
Trotzdem bist du schon längst gefang'n
Willst nie wieder weg, sondern hängst dich an

Denn du bist die letze Hoffnung.“, doch ich denk' nicht dran

Denn er singt und rappt.“, ey, du spinnst komplett

Kein Pimp, kein Chef, deshalb klingt es nett
Denn ich bin, wie ich bin und nicht seit jetzt
Nein im Ernst, dieser Typ war als Kind schon fresh
Und ab heut nie mehr ein Problem
Yeah, alles okay, R-A-O-P
Ist egal, welcher Stern grad wo steht
Wer, was, wo, wen? Scheiß drauf, Cro geht
Wieder voran und hat das Land hinter sich

Also schreibt: „Er spinnt.“, doch ich weiß, ich gewinn'

Lass mich raus! – Zu spät …
Es ist aus, es ist aus!
Hab' Applaus, du Idiot
Du wirst seh'n, ich geh' drauf wegen mir
Nun gut, mach's schnell, ich hoff', es tut nicht weh
Ich hab' Angst, oje – verdammt, tut es weh?
Schon vorbei? Ne! Doch ey, ich hab' gelebt, yeah!

Ich hab' gelebt, ich war auf dem Planet
Hatte vieles zu erzählen, ist ein riesen Privileg
Und jetzt? Jetzt sterb' ich, werd' irgendwo beerdigt
Und komm' sicher in die Hölle, denn ich war nicht immer ehrlich
Ey yo, Mum, es tut mir leid! Ich hab' versprochen, nicht zu rasen
Doch du weißt doch, wie ich bin, ich lass' zu oft die Leute warten
Deshalb wollt' ich mich beeil'n, dass ich zum Kochen wieder da bin
Und jetzt starr' ich auf 'ne Eiche in 'nem Geschoss von einem Wagen

Vollmond, sieben Euro
Drei Homies und 'ne Flasche Billigwodka aufm Volvo
'N ganz normaler Abend mit den Boys und
Was damals so banal war, ist auf einmal von Bedeutung
Privatjet, hier oben ist es leise
Die Bande feiert wild meine Millionen und die Preise
Menschen werden Tiere wegen Drogen, Bitches, Scheine
Ich war mittendrin daneben, aber irgendwie alleine
Seychell'n, sie rennt ins Meer – türkise Well'n
Ich mach' 'n Foto, das schönste der Welt
Sieh' ihre Haare auf dem Moped ohne Helm
Und die feuerrote Sonne kracht in Slomo in die Well'n
Alles Flick, wir bleiben Silvester in Paris
Und dein Lächeln brannte sich in mein Gedächtnis, als du schliefst
Und ich versprech' mir, ich vergess' dich wirklich nie
Hab' genug von Randombitches und den Nächten in Berlin

Ich bin da, ich sehe sie klar
Meine Geburt und Mama lächelt unter Trän'n, hält mich fest – oh mein Gott, ist mir warm!
Hab' endlich 'n Zahn
Vier Kinder grinsen um die Wette, jede VHS-Kassette voller herrlichem Kram
Daddy, guck her! Ich kann fahr'n
Und Mädchen find' ich ätzend, doch ich lande mit sechzehn mit Jessy im Bett
Und versprech', sie zu retten, doch brech' ihr stattdessen nach etlichen heftigen Nächten
Direkt vor dem Essen ihr Herz – ich hoff', es schmeckt

Der Mercedes ist schick, athletischer Schnitt
So böse, aber edel und schlicht
Und jeder Sitz wildleder-bestickt
Ich fass' ihn an, schließ' die Augen und fahr' gegen den Strich
Und ja, Mann, ich erinner' mich noch good
Damals schon im Rover wie Gewinner durch die Hood
Ich bin auf der Rückbank, alle stoned von dem Kush
Es ist Sommer und der Bass drückt durch den Bauch in die Brust
Ich hab' übertrieben Lust und fühle, dass es muss
Fick auf alle andern, Mann, die lügen wie gedruckt
Die Hälfte meiner Jugend nur in Zügen und im Bus
War am üben, doch ich wollte nie auf Bühn'n – das ist Stuss
Die Zeit verging so schnell, wohin mit all dem Geld?
Fünf-Sterne-Hotels, unvernünftig bestellt
Und ich hab' ständig nur Rekorde gebrochen
Und gottverdammte Scheiße, ich bin in den Orbit geschossen

Ich kann geh'n, ich hab' alles geseh'n
Denn ich hab' all die Motherfucker, die mich immer wieder stoppen wollten
Einfach versenkt, einfach versenkt
Hab' mich verloren in den Dingen, die mir wichtig sind
Und deshalb war ich immer zu spät, war immer zu spät
Und nein, ich hab' nicht so getan als wär' mir alles scheißegal
Verdammt, ich hab' es gelebt, ich hab' mich gelebt
Und wenn das hier die letzte Nachricht von mir wär'
Dann würd' ich sagen, ich hab's vor euch geseh'n


Baby, I know, darkness is everything
And I'm feelin' so alone
Baby, I know your love but I would never know you-ou
But I'm feelin' so alone
Why you gotta lie to feel like you're so?
And in my head there's talking, alone

'Cause the leaves are brown
The leaves are brown
The leaves are brown
The leaves are brown

Send me a sign, send me a sign
Baby, I know, time must change everything
And I'm feelin' so hollow, hollow
Baby, I know, here am I
Why don't you think that I'm the one?
The way you've got a lot to love, that's my 
But in my head—

'Cause the leaves are brown

Uh, uh, uh, I'm in the, I'm in the, I'm in the
I'm in the business of making music, that music business
The fitness, no one can witness cause I
I make that crack music (nigga!), uh
That real Black music (nigga!)
The only singles that I'm dropping are the ones
Flapping at the band of your white briefs
White boys please! Can barely believe
I walk by as they hold they skeets by the seams of they jeans
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, and run it to the hills y'all
Straight into my pocket, tired of the deals dog
Start my own label, keep the leaking sealed off
If you got a big mouth, then you might get peeled off
I'm the only fat-lipped bass, my flipper--vroom!--peel off
Eating flounder, Sebastian's like some bath salts
Munching on his bones, looking at him like ""It's yo' fault!""
""Look at what you made me do! Yo, pass the hot sauce""

Looking at the back of Sophia Eris's head
Eating a sammich (but we don't got bread!)
Got a spider ass bite on my head, hangry
Feeling soupy, I brought my fuck in, yo I'm duckin'
Donald, Daffy, Howards, them cowards
Could never throw shots at a super with power
What was Russia without the czars?
What was Henry Ford without the cars?
My grandparents worked at Ford factory
So Henry is nothing without my family tree
And his slave-owning family needed Black blood still
So I think we need a spot up on Henry's will
That would never be the case, in case you ain't keeping up
I'm dishing out cases of that heavy bass
And them bassheads straight from the oppressor's loins
Are giving us our ""Free us!"" in hella coin

So bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories in stadiums and laboratories

Because success and fame be two different things
I remember being sad about boys and stuff
But that was way back in middle school
Now I'm making crowds make noise and stuff
And all my people back home like, ""who knew?""
Normally I don't like to toot my own horn
Cause I don't got a car yet and, well, that sucks
Being a rapper these days ain't what it seems

Was show your mum that you could play piano
Ten years have passed

Is that same old song that we played along and made my mumma cry

In a cartoon land of mysteries
In a place you won't grow old, In a place you won't feel cold
And I’ll sing

Do you remember when you were 15?
And the kids at school called you a fool coz you took the chance to dream
In the time that’s passed and the one thing that lasts
Is that same old song that we played along that made my daddy cry
I miss those days and I miss those ways
When I got lost in fantasies
In a cartoon land of mysteries
In a place you won't grow old, in a place you won't feel cold

Under my feelings, under my skin
Under the thoughts from within
Learning the subtext of the mind
See creation, how we’re defined
My innocent eyes

You mixed me up for someone
Who'd fall apart without you
Yeah you broke my heart for the first time
But I'll get over that too
It's hard to find the reasons
Who can see the rhyme?
I guess that we where seasons out of time
I guess you didn't know me
If you think love is blind
That I wouldn't see the flaws between the lines
Surprised that I caught you out
On every single time that you lied
Did you think that every time I see you I would cry
No not me, not I, not I, no not me, not I
The story goes on without you
And there's got to be another ending
But yeah you broke my heart it won't be the last time
But I'll get over them too
As a new door opens we close the ones behind
And if you search your soul I know you'll find
You never really knew me
If you think love is blind
That I wouldn't see the flaws between the lines
Surprised that I caught you out
On every single time that you lied
Did you think that every time I see you I would cry
No not me, not I, not I, not I, not I

All you promised me
All the mystery never did believe
No I never cry no I never not me not I

Besame tu a mi
Besame igual que mi boca te beso
Dame el frenesi
Que mi locura te dio
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo ensenarte el camino del amor
Muerta mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo
A tu pies
Quiero que vivas solo para mi
Y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea nomas de ti
Besame con frenesi
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Y la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir y amar
Que es mas que amor frenesi
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma piedad corazon
Dime que sabes tu sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo
Quiero que vivas solo para mi

Kiss me
Kiss me the way my mouth kissed you
Give me the frenzy
That my madness gave you
Who if not I
Could teach you the road to love
My pride died
When it tumbled
At your feet
I want you to live just for me
And go where I go
So that my soul belongs only to you
Kiss me with a frenzy
Give me the light of your gaze
And the trembling of your lips
That madness of living and loving
That is more a frenzy than love
In the kiss that I gave you there is
Soul, piety, heart
Tell me that you know how to feel
The same way I feel
I want you to live just for me
And go where I go
So that my soul belongs only to you
Kiss me with a frenzy

A new beginning
A new chapter of my life
Started the day
When I thought
It could be my last
My eyes were wide shut but I
I hadn't given up
Just thought I'd be working
The world alone
Out of the blue
And there I met you
Showed me a life
I can't see without you
And there's just no way
That I can fight these emotions
Your energy running through me
Nobody carried through me like you
Out of the blue
Can this be true?
(Chorus)
Family and friends they were my life
I was the one for butterflies
You give me love that I can't disguise
And there will be times when we're apart
I want you to know you're in my heart
Growing into a beautiful garden
No emotions
My whole body felt like ice
Needed to feel
That the sun will shine my away
My world had turned to dust but I
I had my faith in trust
Just though I'd be working
The world alone
(Chorus)
Family and friends they were my life
I was the one for butterflies
You give me love that I can't disguise
And there will be times when we're apart
I want you to know you're in my heart
Growing into a beautiful garden
Out of the blue
There I met you
I can't believe that this happened so soon
There's just no way
That I can fight these emotions
Your energy running through me
(Out of the blue, there I met you, showed me a life)
I can't see without you, without you, there I met you, you

Colgado del cielo
Por doce cipreses
Doce apostoles de verde
Velan doce meses
A la tapia en ruinas
Que lo delimita
Le han quitado algunas piedras
Para hacer la ermita
Tiene mi cementerio una fosa común
Donde estamos los heroes de Cuba
Los domingos los negros no dejan dormir
Pues les da por cantar misa luba
Y los muertos aquí lo pasamos muy bien
Entre flores de colores
Y los viernes y tal
Si en la fosa no hay plan
Nos vestimos y salimos
Para dar una vuelta
Sin pasar de la puerta eso si
Que los muertos aqui
Es donde tienen que estar
Y el cielo por mi
Se puede esperar
Este cementerio
No es cualquiera cosa
Pues las lapidas del fondo
Son de marmol rosa
Y aunque hay buenas tumbas
Estan mejor los nichos
Porque cuestan mas baratos
Y no hay casi bichos
Luego en plan señorial
El panteon familiar
De los duques Medina y Luengo
Que aunque el juicio final
Nos trate por igual
Aqui hay gente de rancio abolengo
Y los muertos aquí lo pasamos muy bien
Entre flores de colores
Y los viernes y tal
Si en la fosa no hay plan
Nos vestimos y salimos
Para dar una vuelta
Sin pasar de la puerta eso si
Que los muertos aquí
Es donde tienen que estar
Y el cielo por mi
Se puede esperar

We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you’re not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we’re ashes on the ground

I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should’ve let you win

Shoot no 'mones

Get my ass back on the tube?

Letra de ""Nadie Ha Dicho""Y tú por qué esperabas
Para decirme lo que ya nos hiere
El que no arriesga nada
No va al infierno ni va a los altares
Y fue nuestra distancia
Que cómplice de nuestras precauciones
Con su verdad tajante
Nos dividió así en dos direcciones
Perdona si hace algunos días
No he sabido contestarte
Tenía una escapatoria nueva
Y ganas de encontrarme
Y nadie ha dicho que me faltes siempre
A veces nieva improvisadamente
Y algunos ángulos del cielo no verán la luz jamás
Y nadie ha dicho que sea indiferente
A la mirada que te vuelve ausente
Y al egoísmo de un recuerdo al que no puedo renunciar
Búscate un amigo
Que sea el refugio bajo la tormenta
Si lo que yo te debo
Es ser honesta, el resto ya no cuenta
Perdona si hace algunos días
No he sabido contestarte
El tren que lleva al aeropuerto
Me verá alejarte
Y nadie ha dicho que me faltes siempre
A veces nieva improvisadamente
Y algunos ángulos del cielo no verán la luz jamás
Y nadie ha dicho que sea indiferente
A la mirada que te vuelve ausente
Y al egoísmo de un recuerdo al que no puedo renunciar
Y nadie ha dicho
Y nadie ha dicho
Y nadie ha dicho
Y nadie ha dicho
Y quién te ha dicho que sea indiferente
Lo que tu vimos fue tan importante
Nos quedaremos con lo bueno
Y será nuestra liberdad
Perdona si te he confundido
También yo quiero renacer

He wanna see what I'm selling
I put the key in his face
I just got back from the dealer, i got the key to the Wraith
I got the key to the Bentley Truck
When I leave the booth, I'm gone pick it up
Facts, when I'm in my hood, shit I do what I wanna

You better get busy you running up on us, no rat
Ain't no rat nigga

Loyalty only thing matter to me
We bout to bust up some millions
Niggas is ready civilians
We the type never to 
Wait, wait wait, walk in and blow when I step in it

Timing is money and money is time
Hustle like I'm bout to run out of time
Step to a chump in the front of the line
Get on my level I been in the mix

Most of these niggas be popping these pills
Don't know what they talking, they out of they mind
They sipping that lean and popping them percys a thousand a time
They said that they goons get not full bodied they dropping a dime
You said he a hitter, why you was lying?
He hit the district, he posting them pictures and crying for mom
Niggas is rats, gang

If it's fuck me, you know its fuck y'all
Bitch ass niggas, they don't want war
All these choppers in the crib look like a gun store
And the rose gold look like duck sauce in the Maybach
With a young broad why the fuck would I give a fuck for?
We don't lose sleep by the fuck boy
Sending hits like a drug lord, Pablo
Dog food like Ralo
If they all move then they die slow, pronto
Mixing that Louis, that Gucci, that east Saint Laurent with diamond Milano
Feeling that shit that I ride for
Pop a wheelie when we see the 5-0
Who motivate niggas if I go?
Name one at the ClearPort, where you can't come
Eating, finger-licking on the G5
Prime state with the A1
When it come to rappers, I don't be with niggas
I'm still mobbing on them with my day ones
Lil shorty try to play the kid (KIdd) but I'm Jason
Handle that rod like it's And 1
Talking hot sauce when I pop off with the top off
Finna Wraith fan from a popstar
Man I live a life niggas would die for
This that young nigga talk at the dealer shit
When you killing shit, on some winner shit
At the VMA's with the 30 on me
In the front row and who with the shits
Cause these fuck niggas say they want smoke
When we run into 'em we gone kill the shit
Talking really quick
Keep the strap on me like a nigga bitch
All these racks on me I feel nigga rich
Yeah you know, all these racks on me, I feel nigga rich

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul to waste
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
I killed the Tsar and his ministers, Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
Cause what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
(Come on) x3

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
Ah yeah, but what's confusing you
Is the nature of my game

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, who killed the Kennedys ?
When after all, it was you and me
Let me, please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for the troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
It's just the nature of my game

Just as every cop is a criminal and all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politeness or I'll lay your soul to waste
Oh yeah

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, Ohh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is just the nature of my game
Ah yeah, Get down

What's my name?
What's my name?
Lucifer, That's my name baby!
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well

I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages 'til storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose
The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for Love at First Sting

Always the kind to play dirty
Even when you're praying on Sunday
You always find a way to make it 'bout you
It’s not about you
And lately
Why you been acting so shady?
Even when you're praying on Sunday

[Verse 1
I watched you change
Into a fly, oh
I looked away
You were on fire

And I watched a change in you
Like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed

And I watched a change in you
Like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change
Like you never had wings

I look at the cross
Then I look away
Give you the gun
Blow me away

And I watched a change in you
Like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

You feel alive
You feel alive
You feel so alive
I've watched you change

You changed

Coal and flame
Melting those ice hands
An air of mixed feelings
Beneath fallen ceilings
Seal the gates
Before what's out is in
Or offer a treaty
A chance for reprieve
Just let these tunnels cave
Just let this fire fade
Maybe the sky'll break
We're just a lie away
From proving to ourselves we're not afraid
And now
These silver screens, these scripted dreams
And now
We're suddenly

Dando vueltas en la nada
Persiguiendoese fantasma
Que dejaste en mi cama
Porque vuelves como siempre
A cruzarme en mi mirada
Aduearte de mi mente

Que aun me tiemblen las rodillas

Que tus manos me acarician
Dime amiga comopuedo yo calmar

Mas te deseo todavia

Y con mis dedos
Paso a paso te desnuda
Y hasta el alma pierde la cordura

Son tus labios reclamandome la luna

Es abandonar la vida

Letra de ""Tú y yo""
Sigue esa voz que escuchas
Que viene desde adentro
No es normal sentir todo lo que yo siento
Es el amor que me ataca
Que me invade todo el cuerpo
Atrévete no más por el presentimiento
De vivir y amar que es eso lo que cuenta
Si sientes como yo derribaremos puertas
Mírame talvez si quieres tú lo intentas
Ven aquí no dudes, no dudes si te quedas

Quizá no es este el momento perfecto
Pero las cosas de pronto se dan
Sin hacer planes de frente te encuentro
Y yo quiero vivirlo total

Tú y yo vivamos el momento
Tú y yo sin arrepentimientos
Baila, corazón, pero baila que te quiero
Tú y yo, ay pero que bueno
Para que estemos los dos
Para que estemos siempre, siempre tú y yo

Ay, mira que bien se ven tus manos en mi cuerpo
Es una confusión entre concavo y convexo
Y no sé si tendrán nuestras almas un reencuentro
Pero para mí aquí estoy al cien por ciento
De pronto quien iba pensar enamorarse
Pero así es el amor se atraviesa en cualquier parte
Y después de una mirada el corazón flechamos
Siempre llega lo mejor que es estar a tu lado, ¡sí!

Quizá no es este el momento perfecto
Pero las cosas de pronto se dan
Sin hacer planes de frente te encuentro
Y yo quiero vivirlo total

Tú y yo vivamos el momento
Tú y yo sin arrepentimientos
Baila, corazón, pero baila que te quiero
Tú y yo, ay pero que bueno
Para que estemos los dos
Para que estemos siempre, siempre tú y yo
Aquí, vivamos el momento
Tú y yo, sin arrepentimientos
Baila, corazón, pero baila que te quiero
Tú y yo, ay pero que bueno
Para que estemos los dos
Para que estemos siempre, siempre tú y yo

Es cuestión de tacto, como has tasado un pacto
Es cuestión de horas, si lo piensas ya me adoras
Mírame, tócame, ámame, bésame
Todo es culpa tuya, ¡gritamos aleluya!

Para que estemos los dos
Para que estemos siempre, siempre tú y yo
Tú y yo, sin arrepentimientos
Baila, corazón, baila que te quiero
Tú y yo, ay pero que bueno
Para que estemos los dos
Para que estemos siempre, siempre ¡tú y yo!

Science and reason will tell us so
The blood in our veins are just chemicals
You'd better believe I keep my demons to myself
You'd better believe it's getting harder
But I'm never gonna stop until it's broken
Never gonna stop until it's broken

How long 'til we learn
Dancing is dangerous
How long 'til we find
The devil inside of us
How high is too low
We're not that young
So we're never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
Until we break it

Our violence mistaken for silence, oh

Seems like ever since the first day we met
There is no one else I think of more than you
Can't seem to forget, can't get you out my head
Guess the verdict's in, I'm crazy over you
How can one be down, tell me where to start
Cause every time you smile, I feel trembles in my heart
I have but one concern, how can I get with you
Til my day comes, here's what I'm gonna do

Be sitting up in my room
Back here thinking bout you
I must confess, I'm a mess for you
Be sitting up in my room
Back here thinking bout you
I'm just a mess with a thang for you

Pray that you'll invest in my happiness
All it takes is just one simple call from you
Turn my heart around, if I'm making ground
Pretty baby please, tell me if I'm getting through
Tell me what is up, you see I need to know
Tell me if I'm far or, if I'm getting close
I have but one concern, and that one concern is you
Til I'm with you, here's what I'm gonna do

Holly came from Miami F L A
Hitchhiked her way across the U S A
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her legs and then he was a she

Candy came from out on the Island
In the backroom she was everybody's darling
But she never lost her head

Went to the Apollo

I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Yo; This goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this New World the Order slaughter men, women, and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll
Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
Their life and times, deadly like the virus design
But too minute to dilute, the scientist mind

You can't party your life away, Drink your life away
Smoke your life away, Fuck your life away
Dream your life away, Scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way

A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
To skin irritations, babies being born with
Disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
Are hidden by the passing trains
This can't be little Hussein, his uncle cries
As he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
Just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
Bitter sickness, and left us to witness

Yeah, yo; Curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
The wise shall flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
Blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
Zero process, progress, become the hunted
America's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and it caught my little seed
Can it be, the ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
Take in my energy, breath and know the rest
'Cause the good die young and the hard die best

You can't party your life away, Drink your life away
Smoke your life away, Fuck your life away
Dream your life away, Scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way

Y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
While your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in six
You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab, I'm going mad
Took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The white's for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites through the night, by the dawn
Early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe

As we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
Mama say, take your time young man and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings
The cash rule everything now, we going down
These babies looking up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer, brothers, we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other

You can't party your life away, Drink your life away
Smoke your life away, Fuck your life away
Dream your life away, Scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way

I thought I made it clear as crystal
It doesn't have to be this hard
But you ain't good at reading signals
When they come straight from the heart

You've been thinking, you've been thinking
Overthinking, you've been thinking, babe
Just a little too much

Melt the ice and just swim

Feelings. The emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character. A response or tendency to respond. A belief, which can be vague, illogical, but mostly, irrational

I never gave a fuck on how the next nigga felt
I rocked a heavyweight belt cause that's the way I felt
Still feel, so inspired to write a rhyme that's ultimately
No other emcee could get with me, is way I felt
Don't forget the first time you heard me rhyme the way
The first time you heard ""Protect Ya Neck"", the way you felt
Like no other hip hop record ever made you felt
Cards dealt, played my handle, when no matter how I felt

Every time we touch the mic, you know our lyrics is felt
Worldwide, live, polaroid shit, all my homies is
And we ride out to all of our music is
Yeah, we gets busy, teach the youth  because we know how it felt
Give em Knowledge of self expressing in a way that it's felt
So each and every person to recognize what they felt
Watch your mind state because the evil could be felt
You never know, how when I first came out, how my brothers felt
I've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt
We would last for a night, but a better tomorrow

I felt the angel of death breathe
When I felt the four fifths something told me squeeze
I felt like it was the end of a dynasty
Like I was fighting a clique of five Chinese thieves
Karate slippers with slip on's so I kept slippin'
The floor was too smooth felt like I couldn't catch a grip in
Felt like Dragonfly Jones, was Dragonfly Tone
So I kept spitting, woke up when I heard the phone

I never gave a what on how the next rapper felt
I take that rapper's belt myself, I feel how Cappa felt
I don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt
Marker, walk on water, I see how Jesus felt
No rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt
This about a thesis that even paraplegics felt
These boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it
Till you got cheated, you couldn't tell me how cheating felt
I'm not a failure, I couldn't tell ya how losing felt
Might not have nailed her, but I can tell ya how spooning felt
Remember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt
I burned the track with a murder rap and I know it's felt

Forever with bars, sort of like a lifer
With the son of anarchy, I be breaking bad
Walking dead, day dreaming of making a band
Dancing with the stars, Americans idol me

Putting other niggas on, teaching ‘em thug shit

That's my bird and that's my word
You faggots keep fucking around and get curbed

Forms circles like the rings of Saturn
Dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
Then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
A wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
A wild fire engulfing every home
It's history chiseled and carved in every stone
A workshop where skills are learned
Handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern
Urban center provided with a social structure
And a curious culture full of superconductors
Each stain is part of a scene with
Intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
Spell bounding, marvelous and it's surrounding
Viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
A place where the forgotten art is so powerful
A striking image is something that's so valuable

This one's the blackout! Three-fifty-seven to your mouth!

The finest threads cover my frame, the cloths of royalty
Strive with an army of winners and no pretenders

But first we gotta win with no stalemate
The all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man

Armored trucks, tanks are bulletproof, been the truth
Loot the track, clear the booth, my thought ready, aim, shoot
My knowledge one twenty proof, let's tear the roof off
Let's spray, M-A-S-T-A
King I Love-Love club, pack stadium rock
I hold the mic snug, split a slug
Black ninja, mask and gloves

Come to Brazil
Come, come, come

Come to Brazil!

So I'm walking in the club and I'm like ""Oi, migas!""
And what do I see
But the most gorgeous, sexy man I've ever laid eyes up on
And just when I think it's love at first sight
I realize we're both ""passivonas""
Ugh

Brazil is so nice, so I'll say it twice
Brazil is so nice, Brazil is so nice
Brazil is so nice, so I'll say it thrice
Brazil is so nice, Brazil is so nice, Brazil is so nice
Oi! Whoo!

Britney, Mariah, Shania, Céline
They all want to come to Brazil, baby
Rihanna, Ariana and Gaga and me
We all want to come to Brazil, baby
So co-o-o-o-ome!
Come to Brazil!
Oh, oh, o-o-o-oh, oh, oh
Come to Brazil!

So I'm walking down the streets
Of one of Brazil's gorgeous cities
And I keep hearing people yell ""Crackuda! Crackuda!""
Now, I don't speak portuguese
But I can only assume that ""Crackuda"" means
""Gorgeous, beautiful, young woman""
...Right?

Brazil is so nice, so I'll say it twice
Brazil is so nice, Brazil is so nice
Brazil is so nice, so I'll say it thrice
Brazil is so nice, Brazil is so nice, Brazil is so nice
Oi! Whoo!

Britney, Mariah, Shania, Céline
They all want to come to Brazil, baby
Rihanna, Ariana and Gaga and me
We all want to come to Brazil, baby
So co-o-o-o-ome!
Come to Brazil!
Oh, oh, o-o-o-oh, oh, oh
Come to Brazil!

In Brazil they speak ""Portugayse""
Which is the language of love
Do you wanna hear some words that I learned how to say?
I really think I've taken command of the language
Alright, sure, okay, here we go
Porto Alegre
Fortaleza
Curitiba
Brasília
Rio
São Paulo
Uh!

Preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river

It's not what I had planned when I was walking in
I didn't know what I'd see, stepping through the door
Their clothes were on the floor
Was something like a bad dream

And then in just a blink, before I could think
I didn't know what happened
All I knew was this
How could he commit, a crime against our passion?

Oh, the moment that I saw them kiss
Oh, I knew it had to end like this

Preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river
I couldn't help myself
When I saw him with her, with her
I took that loaded gun
Forgive what I have done
So preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river

The writing's on the wall, but it was his fault
How could anybody blame me
I swear to tell the truth, and if you only knew
I swear, you'd do the same thing

Oh, if you give me one more chance
Oh, I'll never shoot him down again so...

I've been knock, knock, knocking
At the thought of your door
But you're not, not, not here anymore
I ring, ring, ring your every phone in my head
But I can't get through the connection is dead
I want, want to tell you about the news today
But you wouldn't believe me, you'd laugh it away
There's a ghost standing at the foot of my bed
And it's you, it's you, it's you...

It was you they told me who was in trouble
I couldn't breathe on the other side of the world
And there was nothing I could do to help you...
And it's true today would be your birthday
It would've been your 27th year
And I miss you, in the earth's atmosphere
I wish you were here...

I go back, back, back and every memory you're there
But the clock ticks over every minute we shared
On my knees begging for it not to be true
But it was you, it was you, it was you

It was you they told me who was in trouble
I couldn't breathe on the other side of the world
And there was nothing I could do to help you...
And it's true today would be your birthday
It would've been your 27th year
And I miss you, in the earth's atmosphere
I wish you were here...

Instead of just in my dreams and in my imagination
Confusing me completely from another dimension
Can you see the beauty from a new beginning somewhere
Cause I feel like I won't repair with time...
It was you, it was you, it was you...

It was you they told me who was in trouble
I couldn't breathe on the other side of the world

Tell me your thoughts now baby
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's eating you alive
Tell me your darkest secrets
Clear up those stupid lies
Show me what's there behind those eyes
I wanna know cause I can't face another day here in the dark

Six thoughts at once I can't focus on one
Seven days a week but my life has just begun
So caught in emotion and I'm overcome
As I'm falling down I come undone
Sometimes I feel like I'm alone
Sometimes I feel like I'm not that strong
Sometimes I feel so frail so small
Sometimes I feel vulnerable
Sometimes I feel a little fragile
A little fragile
In six thousand years what will this mean
Words from the heart or a melody
So caught in emotion and I'm overcome
As I'm falling down I come undone
Sometimes I feel like I'm alone
Sometimes I feel like I'm not that strong
Sometimes I feel nothing at all
Sometimes I feel vulnerable
Sometimes I feel a little fragile
A little fragile
If people can see right through my eyes
Like an open door that I can't disguise
I won't be afraid from the tears I cry
I'll not run I'll not hide this is how I feel inside
A little fragile
A little fragile
Sometimes I feel like I'm alone

Prepare yourself to meet
A girl who cannot sleep
Dividing every question till
The questions are complete
Every twisted tongue
She studies everyone
She won't leave any stone unturned
The night is oh so young
Oh oh
She's traveling back in time
Questioning every line
That someone said
Oh oh
She's trying to understand
Free her mind
She's always the analyst
Silent space
The culprit
The catalyst
Trying to make sense of her life
Digging around in the dirt
She's a slave to the work
She's always the analyst
Can you be sure we haven't met
See the eyes
They don't forget
They wander through the passageways
That tease a restless mind
Can't afford to slip
The picture's gotta fit
Her world's a photograph
That gets dissected bit by bit

The mistake she's made
Not a moment for
The curious girl
Free her mind

The catalyst

Digging around
Breaking it down
Neurotic thoughts
Burning the ground

Every sound

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
In the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines
Come on skinny love what happened here
We suckled on the hope in lite brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And who the hell was I?
'Cause now I'm breaking at the bridges
And at the end of all your lines
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?
Come on skinny love

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His says body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school that's what I did

You got a fast car
But Is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

I remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I… I had a feeling that I belonged
I… I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car man keep on driving

I remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I… I had a feeling that I belonged
I… I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away
You gotta make a decision

Should I hold my tongue?
Should I keep you guessing?
Cause after all it’s done
I have learnt my lesson
But there’s something different about this time
Something clearer about my mind
And now I’m leaning towards your dreaming
As all my dreaming runs wild, circus child
It’s been a long, long time
Since I left my window
But what was there to find
But stacks of broken arrows?
Now I’m burning the clothes I wore
Now I’m shedding the sights I saw
And I hope no spaces can hide your aces
Cause all my aces are played, circus babe
And so I say to you:
Let’s not force a meaning
Forget the lines we drew
Forget your teenage demons
We have nothing to state or prove
We have nothing to fear or lose
And I’ll be trying to catch you hiding
As all my hiding is seen, circus queen

Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here’s a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you
This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing

You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda' kept my undershirt

You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll


Cut the cord and pull some strings
Make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don’t fly
Someone’s going to paint you another sky

'Cause you’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall?

Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave, by the dead
I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane

Is to hear you cry
I'd love, to hear you cry
I'd love, to feel you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last, to leave
I'd love, to hear you cry

And when you're down, beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame

Oh lady cry, and say goodbye

때론 그 땜에 울고
힘들어할 때면

네가 혹시나 내 마음을 알게 될까 봐
알아 버리면 우리 멀어지게 될까 봐

또 입술을 깨물어

버릇처럼 혼자 너에게 말하고
매일 밤 그렇게 불안했던 걸 보면
난 이렇게 될 거란 걸 알았는지도 몰라
난 눈을 감아, 끝이 없는 꿈을 꿔

착각 속에 홀로 바보처럼 살았죠

No más falsas batallas, no más grilletes de una falsa actitud
Fuimos corriendo contra el Sol, viviendo con miedo
Ahora las cosas cambian, cortar de tajo con lo que nos dolió
Puño cerrado al viento y voluntad de hierro
Vamos otra vez, peleando con el puño al aire
Con el corazón, con la actitud entre las manos
No más tristeza, ni soledad, no hay más pasado que recordar
Ésta va por los hermanos, por los amigos que hemos visto partir
Siempre muy dentro vivirán sonriendo, sonriendo
Por los que sobreviven, por los que nunca dejarán de luchar
Por abrazarnos junto al mar ya viejos, ya viejos

Vamos otra vez, peleando con el puño al aire
Con el corazón, con la actitud entre las manos
No más tristeza, ni soledad, no hay más pasado que recordar

You know the way back, I’m right here
She’s a liar, you said you weren’t gonna leave
Why do I only remember the good memories?
Where are you? I’m right here
Don’t leave
What should I do to live?
Don’t leave, don’t make me suffer in pain
My heart aches, I can’t endure this
Please tell me now that it was a lie, a joke

No puedo estar en ningún lugar
Ni con mis discos me siento en paz
Cualquier canción siempre habla de ti
Que difícil es olvidar no hay manera de regresar
Y poco a poco lograste entrar en mi corazón de metal
Ojos miel te voy a extrañar que difícil es olvidar
No hay manera de regresar a ti baby...

Y encendiste mi corazón
Ahora que no te tengo estoy quemándome de amor

Trimmin' the bream with the blade and lawnmow'

One day they'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me
Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have foreva
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same
Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free
Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

If I can't have you, let love set you free

Transformed your love into light
Baby believe me I'm sorry I told you lies
I turned day into night
Sleep till I died a thousand times

Better night better times better days
And I miss you more, and more

Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say sit down; it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Si una vez escribí tu nombre junto al mío en la pared
Hoy regreso a dejar flores a la sombra de un ciprés
Si tu voz ya no es mi maestra ni en el arte de ofender
¿Qué más da recordar quién eras
O de quién yo me enamoré?

Si ya no queda nada de qué hablar
Si ya no queda nada qué callar
Cómo puede ser qué duela tanto
Sin miedo en el infierno al recordar
Si vuelve a ser domingo al despertar
Quédate conmigo aquí a mi lado

Cuando el tren de una historia muerta pasa tiempo en el andén
Puede ser que la hierba crezca y se entierre en nuestros pies
¿Qué más da quién pagó la cena o si dejamos a deber?
Si el silencio dibujaba con las migas del mantel

Si ya no queda nada de qué hablar
Si ya no queda nada qué callar
Cómo puede ser qué duela tanto
Sin miedo en el infierno al recordar
Si vuelve a ser domingo al despertar
Quédate conmigo aquí a mi lado

¿Qué más da mirarnos si siempre es diciembre?
¿Qué más da cruzar los dedos si ya no me mientes?
¿Qué más da que llueva?
¿Qué más da mojarnos si bajo el paraguas no vas de mi brazo?
¿Qué más da quien eras si nadie responde?
¿Qué más da esperar despierta si al volver te escondes?
¿Qué más da el silencio siempre tan sincero, siempre tan atento entre tú y yo
Cuando no hay remedio?

When you first left me, I was wanting more
But you were fucking that girl next door, what'cha do that for?
When you first left me, I didn't know what to say
I've never been on my own that way, just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile, I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me, you say that you want me back
And I tell you it don't mean jack, no, it don't mean jack
I couldn't stop laughing, no, I just couldn't help myself
See, you messed up my mental health, I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone

Yes! So crazy right now!
Most incredibly, it's your girl, B
It's your boy, Young
You ready?

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no

History in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no

When I talk to my friends so quietly
""Who he think he is?"" Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Oh, crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Oh)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Hey)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Hey)
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

I'm warmed up now, let's go
Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco
Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh (Oh)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (Oh no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony Soprano (Oh, no)
The ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, If anything I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
Crazy, bring ya whole set
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?"" (Oh, no)
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova?
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back Young, ever since I made the change over
To platinum, the game's been a wrap, one

Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me, so crazy, baby
Hey!

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)

Your healthy, unhealthy voices
It's several for me

Now who wants to live the soul's desire
Way down we're born to realize
One sobering thought was forced upon
We shall know, we'll know

These slivers that warn our feet
Reminders joining us
To the rest, to the worst, the worst is yet to come
To the rest, all the best, the best is yet to come

Now who wants to live the soul's desire
Way down we're born to realize
One sobering thought was forced upon
We shall know, we'll know

A silent stare brings the creeping clone
Won't feel you walking in but feel you walking out
Your silent stare brings us closer still
And all her wants out
Keep biting in

Well excuse me, take a few minutes, to mellow out
Big Daddy Kane is on the mic and I'mma tell about
A minimum length, of rhymes of strength
And power, so listen to the man of the hour
Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
Sing ho, swing low, then yo the show
Will go on, as I perform
Transformin on stage like a Decepticon
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
I'm for real, shootin lyrics like a harpoon
Across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators
So let's groove with the smooth operator

""Cause I'm so smooth...""
The B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y-K-A-N-E
I'm good and plenty, servin many and any
Competition, wishin' for an expedition
I'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen
Rappers act so wild, and love to profile
Frontin hard but ain't got no style
I give nightmares to those who compete
Freddy Kreuger, walkin' on Kane Street
Confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
Who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
Destruction from the exterminator
But in a calm manner, cause I'm a smooth operator

""Cause I'm so smooth...""

Now girls step up to this
One simple kiss, and it's over, Miss
Sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
Girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
So just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling
Cause It's a Big Daddy Thing
And I'm lovin em right, word is bond
So just play Marvin Gaye and Let's Get It On
I make it real good like Dr. Feelgood
To make sure that my point is understood
That when it comes to this there's none greater
Sincerely yours... the smooth operator

""Cause I'm so smooth...""

Now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
Sayin' I'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
The smooth way I say 'em and the way I display 'em
To make them sound different in a way that's gifted
And hey I'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine
And I make one line, bright as the sunshine
Attack you like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know -- step off
Competition, I'mma get rid of
You can't get a bit of, so just consider
A break or rest, vacation, hibernation
And make way for my smooth operation
I'm a smooth operator

""Cause I'm so smooth...""

And I still ain't half-steppin, peace!

Cold gettin' dumb - yeah!
Aight, here we go once again
Back, for more, with the one, Sir Vicious Just Ice
My man Mantronix providin' the funky sound for your listenin' pleasure
To rock it on to the break of dawn
On and down to the A.M
With my man DMX, the original human beatbox
Yo change the bass
Keep it on like this to the break of dawn
Show you how a real MC cold rocks the mic and gets things right

It's like that, never the wack, in actual fact
It's like this dominant black, come right and exact
So nice very precise yes, Just-Ice
Like this never no tricks you see it's Justice
To the best of my knowledge I guess that I'm fresh
And when I manifest I never protest
So you say you never melt, you're supposed to be an adult
Sympathetic emotions I never felt so get help
You know that you are lost
And you know that if you're meltin', that you are soft
Just-Ice, Sir Vicious, is here to rock on
Tell you all about myself, let my knowledge be born
Respect on the mic when it comes to a rhyme
If you think we're much alike you know you're out of your mind
As I reminisce your chance ended
To try to convince me to believe your stupid nonsense
I'm twice as nice, a gripping vice, precise Just Ice
Rockin' parties nine years of my life
It's a new conceptual, highly intellectual
For me, only 'cause it is genetical
'Cause now, 'bout to get loose, got gallons of juice
To pour, and more if you want to choose
Negotiable and sociable is done
But let's build and we'll all have fun so don't run
'Cause if you leave you will be fooling yourself
You better go and seek some better help
It's time to stop bein' stubborn, and so defiant
Just hear my words, acknowledge my science
But if you're crying like the rain, I know it's the pain
Obtain some math, and move your brain
To a new potential, identical, the main principle
The science I speak well everything is just rational
The most pressin', I'm giving you a lesson
I test the rest they gets depressed
They didn't appreciate the agony, of defeat
It's the way that I did it, that made it sweet
'Cause the people all around agree
My rap is intellect with high velocity
I'm speakin' about me, a delicate wish
Sir Vicious so smooth like a rimless swish
Come with me young ladies it's not too hard
Wanna make you my baby and complete the job
Like a psychopathological syndrome
My beneficial words are gonna be known
Theoretical dilemma facts hard to pen
Just Ice Sir Vicious done rocked it again

(Mantronix cold getting ill)
(Rock the beats)

Peace, to all, that, could come
The time is now the deed must be done
Cos I rock, and also will devastate
Your thoughts then start to manipulate
The bass beats as I start to capture
Every beat in sequence, including the scratch
Turn off that music and go acapella
Match the sound to my voice, then you'll start to treasure
My intelligent, eloquent way of rap
Poetic philosophy, yes down pat
Inevitable rights, to party all night
Double counter second amateur twice
A prototype to endure, my wrath, is much to contain
Alleviate the latter, and crush the remain
Opportunist victim in a state of shock
You caught a bad decision and now you are stopped
By the one that's called, most vicious of them all
Cos even if I sit, I still stand tall
On the most incredible, elevated pedestal
That's hard to beget, but never forgettable
Rap connoisseur, who only gives more
And I am sure my rhymes never bore anyone
Who listen 'cause I got your attention
Diabolical scheme, now here's my invention
A poem, a rap, a haiku in fact
When my opponent hears this ???
A bunch of rhymes, you're just a beginner
With two thousand left I'm bound to be a winner
It's like that on the comeback in actual fact
Like this, sweet as a kiss, as y'all reminisce
It's like this never the wack in actual fact
Stand back or you might get slapped, Jack

Ah yeah
(All you sucker niggas get off my dick!)
That's the way it's really done when you cold rock the party with an MC like precise Just-Ice
(Peace)

Walk you to the counter
What you got to offer
Pick you out a soda
Look at you forever
Walk you to the water
Eyes like a casino
You ain't born typical
Find a piece of silver
Pretty as a diagram
Go down to the Rio
Put it in my left hand
Put it in a fruit machine
Everyone's a winner
Laughing like a seagull

You are a fever, you are a fever
You ain't born typical
You are a fever, you are a fever
You ain't born typical

Living in a suitcase
Meet a clown and fall in love
Been dying to have you over
Clown around and break up
Take you to a jukebox
That's the situation
Pick you out a number
That's our arrangement
Dancing on the legs of a new born pony
Left right left right, keep it up son
Go ahead and have her, go ahead and leave her
You only ever had her when you were a fever

I am a fever, I am a fever
I ain't born typical
I am a fever, I am a fever
I ain't born typical
We are a fever, We are a fever
We ain't born typical
We are a fever, We are a fever
We ain't born typical

Oye
La Palestina
Nando vamos aya

Cuando yo la vi en Oriente
Ella me gritaba cosas hermosas
Y despues la encontre en La Habana
Y se estaba creyendo cosa
No se si eran las buenas prendas ( O que )
No si si era le vestimenta ( vaya )
No estoy contento con su actitud ( Dale )
Porque me dijo no te reprendas ( Apretaste )
Esas es la historia muy cotidiana
Y te lo voy a contar entera
La Palestina ya no es cubana
Tiene dinero y se va pa afuera
Candela

La Palestina tiene dinero y
Ya no es cualquiera ( Ya no es qualquiera
La Palestina lucho su visa y
Se va pa afuera ( Eso Lo sabe La Habana entera )
La Palestina tiene dinero y
Ya no es cualquiera ( Ya no es qualquiera )
La Palestina lucho su visa y
Se va pa afuera ( Eso Lo sabe La Habana entera )

Se cogio pa eso
Esa Palestiana se cree mejor que el queso
Vino hace tres dias
Y ya no tiene ni este peso ( Como )
Quiere estar conmigo
Y eso lleva su proceso ( Que )
Lo que termino
Empiezo ahora ve tumbando
Recuerdo aquel dia
En la embajada caminando
Buena pinta sobre el isa
Arrazando con tremenda risa
Me dijiste vete echando ( Ay La Palestina esta acabando )
Esto es privado me senti asolado
Ahora viene a verme porque estoy mandado
Quiere disculparse
Y que este a su lado ( Como )
No te pongas brava mami
Pero estoy pegado

La Palestina tiene y
Ya no no es cualquiera ( Ya no es qualquiera )
La Palestina lucho la visa y
Se va pa afuera ( Eso lo sabe La Habana entera )
La Palestina tiene y
Ya no no es cualquiera ( Ya no es qualquiera )
La Palestina lucho la visa y
Se va pa afuera ( Eso lo sabe La Habana entera )

Ay ella me engano ( Y solito me dejo )
Ella me dijo que me queria
Pero el dinero la transformo ( Repitelo )
Ay ella me engano ( Y solito me dejo )
Ella me dijo que me queria
Pero el dinero la transformo

Esa mujer que poco me queria
Vino pa La Habana
Y le cambio la vida
Me trato muy mal
Mira que descortesia
Yo soy Gente de Zona
Y estoy vivo todavia ( Dale )

Ay que poco me queria ( Que poco me qeria )
Me cambio por piticlines y una visa
Que mala suerte la mia
Ay que poco me queria ( Que poco me qeria )
Me cambio por Fiticlines y una visa
Que mala suerte la mia

Y su familia me esta haciendo una campaсa

Le gustan los feos no le gustan los bonitos
Asн que rompan filas, dejen a la chiquilla
Ustedes no son quien pa mandar en sus cosquillas
Si me ven, me caen en pandilla
Si le gustan los feos eso no es culpa mнa

Soy feo por fuera y bonito por dentro
Si fuera un mango tu padre esta contento
Y no me da la gana, y por eso me retengo

There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road while you're traveling

They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know that they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing my suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know that they won't win

Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all


I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

30 August YEAR 22
Can anyone remember the moment they fall in love? Can anyone predict the moment their love will end? What could be the reason that humans don’t have the ability to recognize those moments? And why was I given the power to return all of those things?
The car came to a sudden stop, the headlights flash, crashing, bouncing, falling. I did nothing but stand defenseless in the face of all of those moments. I heard no sound and felt no sensations. It was summer, but the wind seemed cold. There was the sound of something tumbling along the street. Then there was the scent of flowers. Only then did a sense of reality come to me. The bouquet of Smeraldo flowers fell from my hand. She was laying there in the middle of the street. There was blood flowing in between the strands of her hair. The dark red blood flowers along the street. I thought, “If only I could turn back time.”
Seokjin
12 July YEAR 20
Past the school doors, the sound of cicadas prickled my ears. The school yard was crowded with kids laughing and playing and competing in races. It was the start of summer vacation and everyone was chattering. I ducked my head and walked in between them. I wanted to leave as quickly as I could.
“Hyung.” I lifted my head surprised by the sudden appearance of someone’s shoulder. It was Hoseok and Jimin. They looked at me, their smiles as wide and bright as ever and their eyes full of mischief. “Today is the start of vacation, are you still going to leave?” Hoseok asked tugging at my arm. I muttered, “sure,” and a few more meaningless words, then turned my head away. What had happened that day was clearly an accident. It wasn’t intentional. I hadn’t imagined that Jungkook and Yoongi would be in the storage room at that time. The principal suspected that I was covering for my dangsaengs. I had to say something. But in the end Yoongi had gotten expelled. Nobody knew that I had been the complicit.
“Have a good vacation hyung! I’ll call you.” Maybe having interpreted my expression, Hoseok let his hand drop slightly and forced an even brighter greeting. I couldn’t answer this time either. There was nothing I could say. As I passed the school gate, I thought of the first day I had come to this school. We had all been punished  for tardiness together. We could laugh because of it. I had ruined these moments.
Yoongi
15 June YEAR 22
I wasn't aware of anything other than the sound of music playing in my head. Not how much I had drunk, nor where I was, nor what I had been doing. I didn’t know, and it wasn’t important. When I went outside, stumbling, it was already night. I swayed as I walked. I bumped into pedestrians, news kiosks, walls. I didn’t care. I just wanted to forget everything.
Jimin’s voice was still ringing in my ears. “Hyung, Jungkook…” My next memory was of running like crazy up the hospital steps. The hospital hall had been strangely long and dark. I passed people wearing hospital gowns. My heart pounded. Everyone’s faces were too pale. They had no expressions. They all seemed like dead people. The sound of my breathing was harsh inside my own head.
Inside the slightly opened hospital room door, Jungkook was lying there. I turned my head without realizing it. I couldn’t look at him. At that moment I suddenly heard the sound of a piano, of flames, of a building crumbling down. I clutched my head and sank down. “This is your fault. If it wasn’t for you…” It was my mother’s voice- no my voice- no someone’s voice. At those words I was tormented by countless moments. I wanted to believe it wasn’t so. But Jungkook was lying there. Jungkook was lying in a hall full of corpse like patients passing by, I was utterly unable to go inside. I couldn’t check for myself. When I stood, my legs threatened to give out. I left with tears flowing. It was funny. I couldn’t even remember the last time I had cried.
I went to cross the street, but someone grabbed my arm and I came to a halt. Who was it? No, I didn’t care. No matter who it was, it was all the same. Don’t come near me. Go away. Just leave me be. I don’t want to hurt you either. I don’t want to be hurt. So please, don’t come any closer.
Yoongi
12 June YEAR 19
I thoughtlessly ditched school, but truthfully I didn’t have anywhere to go. It was hot. I had no money, and I had nothing to do. It was Namjoon who said we should go to the beach. The younger kids seemed excited, but I didn’t particularly feel like it, nor did I dislike the idea. “Do we have money?” At my question Namjoon made everyone shake out their pockets. A few coins, a few bills. “So we can’t go.” The one who said we could just walk was probably Taehyung. Namjoon made a face begging them to reconsider, but the kids just chattered away laughing and pretending to roll around on the road before starting to walk. I wasn’t in the mood to talk back so I just fell behind. It was midday, so even the gingko trees couldn’t provide shade, and the cars kicked up dust as they passed us on the sidewalkless road.
“Let’s go there.” It was Taehyung this time too. Or was it Hoseok? I didn’t care so I didn’t look carefully, but it would have been one of them. I had been walking along with my head down, kicking dirt. When I almost collided with someone I lifted my head. Jimin was standing there as if frozen in place. The muscles in his face trembled as if had seen something terrifying. He was staring at a sign that said “Flowering Arboretum, 2.2 kilometers.""
“I didn’t want to walk.” I heard Jungkook’s voice. Sweat dripped from Jimin’s face. He went pale, as if he might collapse at any second. What is it? I had a strange feeling. “Park Jimin.” I called, but as I expected he didn’t budge. I lifted my head again and looked at the sign.
“Hey, it’s so hot. Why would we go to an arboretum? Let’s go to the beach.” I said as if dragging my feet. I didn’t know what kind of place the arboretum was, but it didn’t seem like we should go. Whatever the reason, Jimin’s expression was strange. “We don’t even have money.” Hoseok replied. “That’s why we’re walking.” And Taehyung added, “If we just walk to the train station we can probably make it.” Then Namjoons said, “Instead we’ll just starve at dinner.” Jungkook and Taehyung pretended to cry, and Seokjin hyung laughed. Jimin only started to move again once it was decided that we would take the road toward the train station. Walking with his head down and his shoulders trembling, Jimin seemed like a small child. I looked up at the sign again. The characters spelling “Flowering Arboretum” were gradually getting further away.
Namjoon
13 July YEAR 22
I rested my head against the bus window. From the library to the gas station, the scenery passed by the window, almost frighteningly familiar since I took this route everyday. Would there come a day I could leave this scenery behind? I felt that it was impossible to predict what tomorrow would bring, nor to hope for anything.
There was a woman sitting in front of me, her hair tied with a yellow rubber band. Her shoulders lifted and then dropped as if she was sighing. Then she rested her head against the window. For around a month already, we had studied at the same library and gotten on the bus at the same stop. We hadn’t spoken a word to each other, but we looked at the same scenery and lived on the same time and sighed the same sighs. The hair tie was still in my pant’s pocket.
The woman always got off the bus three stops before I did. Every time I saw her leave, I wondered if she was going to distribute fliers. What kind of time was she spending, what kind of things was she enduring? How strongly did she feel stifled at the thought that tomorrow might not come, or that from the beginning there had never been such a thing as tomorrow? I thought things like that.
The woman’s stop began to approach. Someone pressed the stop request button and other passengers stood up from their seats. But in the midst of this, that woman didn’t stir. She just stayed in her seat, her head against the window. It seemed like she was asleep. Should I go and wake her? I fought with myself for a moment. The bus approached the stop. The woman didn’t move. People disembarked. The door closed and the bus started to move.
The woman didn’t wake, even as we passed the next three stops. As I moved to the bus door I fought with myself again. It was clear that once I got off the bus, no one else would pay attention to her. She would wake up somewhere far from her stop, and it was impossible to know how much more tired she would be today because of it.
I left the bus stop and started to walk toward the gas station. The bus took off and I didn’t look back. I had left the hair tie on top of her bag, but that was it. That wasn’t a beginning, and as such nor was it an end. It was nothing to start with and there was no reason for it to be anything. So I thought it really didn’t matter.
Namjoon
17 December YEAR 21
The people waiting for the bus rubbed their hands together in the cold. I looked down at the dirt, clutching the strap of my bag. I was trying to not make eye contact with anyone. It was a countryside village where only two buses stopped per day. From a distance, I saw the first bus approaching.
I boarded the bus behind everyone else. I didn’t look back. When I was passionate about something, when I barely had something in my grasp, when I had nothing left but things to escape- I had conditions. I wasn’t to look back. The moment I looked back the efforts I’d made until now became little more than seafoam. Looking back, that was a kind of suspicion, a kind of lingering attachment, and a kind of fear. Only when I had overcome these things could I finally escape.
The bus started off. I had no plans. I had nothing I was passionate about, nothing in my group, no particular reason to escape. It was closer to thoughtlessly running away from my mother’s tired face, my wandering sibling, my father’s illness. Starting with the situation in our house that grew more difficult with every passing day, from my family, who enforced sacrifice and tranquility, and from me who pretended to know nothing and restrained myself from trying to adjust and grow resigned. But most of all it was closer to running from poverty.
If anyone asked if it’s a crime to be poor, everyone would say it’s not. But is that really the truth? Poverty gnaws on so many things. Things that were precious become meaningless. You give up things you can’t give up. You grow suspicious and fearful and resigned.
The bus would arrive at a familiar stop in a few hours. When I left from that place a year ago I had left no message behind. And now I was returning with no sign or warning. I tried to recall my friend’s faces. I had cut off contact with all of them. What were they all doing these days? Would they be glad to see me? Would we be able to get together and laugh the way we had back then? There was frost on the windows and I couldn’t see the scenery outside. On top of the frost, I slowly moved my finger.
“I have to survive.”
Hoseok
4 July YEAR 22
I stood in the hallway the whole time she was receiving first aid. Even though it was night, the hospital hallway was bustling with people. Moisture dripped from my hair, wet with sweat and rain. I dropped the bag I had taken off of her. A variety of things tumbled out of it. A few coins rolled away, and a ball pen and a towel. In the middle of it all was an airplane e-ticket. I picked it up and scanned it.
At that moment, the doctor called me. He said it was a mild concussion and nothing to worry about, and after a moment, she came out as well. “Are you okay?” She said that her head just hurt a little, and she took her bag from me. Then she spotted the e-ticket peeking out, and looked up at my face. I shifted my bag to my other shoulder and said that we should go, pretending that it was nothing. As we left the hospital it was raining as hard as ever. We stood side by side outside the door.
“Hoseok-ah” she said. It looked like she had something to say. “Wait a second. I’ll get an umbrella.” I ran off thoughtlessly into the rain. There was a convenience store in the distance. I knew that she had auditioned for an overseas dance team some time ago. The plane ticket meant that she had made it. I didn’t want to hear her say it. I didn’t have the confidence to congratulate her.
Hoseok
23 July YEAR 10
When I counted to three, I heard the sound of laughter like a hallucination. The next moment the young me passed by holding someone’s hand. I looked back quickly, but there was no one there except my classmates staring at me. “Hoseok-ah,” the teacher called my name. Only then did I realize where I was. It was a class field trip. I was counting the fruits that were drawn in the textbook. Five. Six. I kept counting, but as I did my voice trembled and my hands grew sweaty. The memory of that time kept surfacing.
I couldn’t clearly remember my mother’s face that day. I only remembered the chocolate bar she gave me as we looked around the amusement park. “Hoseok-ah. Count to ten and then open your eyes.” When I had finished counting and opened my eyes, my mother was gone. I waited and waited, but she never returned. I had only counted to nine. If I counted one more it would have been fine, but my voice wouldn’t come out. My ears were ringing and my surroundings grew cloudy. The teacher kept pointing, telling me to keep counting. My friends were staring at me. I couldn’t remember my mother’s face. It seemed like if I counted one more, my mother would really never come back for me.
Just like that, I collapsed to the ground.
Jimin
4 July YEAR 22
By the time I returned to my senses, I had washed my arm so much that I was losing skin. My hands were trembling and I was short of breath. My eyes were bloodshot. What had just happened came back to me in fragments.
For a moment I had lost focus. I was dancing with a noona from the dance club, a collaborative dance, but I had lost my flow and we collided. I fell to the rough floor and my arm started to bleed. At that moment I had remembered what happened at the Flowering Arboretum. I thought that I had overcome it. But that wasn’t the case. I had to run away. I had to wash it away. I had to look away. The me in the mirror was the same eight-year-old kid who had run away in the rain. Then all at once I realized. Noona had fallen down too.
There was nothing I could do. All I could do was fall and hurt someone, leave them behind, and tremble at my own pain only to run after them too late with an umbrella before stopping. Every time I took a step rainwater soaked my sneakers. Car headlights passes me by. It wasn’t okay. No it was okay. It didn’t hurt. It wasn’t that serious of an injury. I was really okay.
Jimin
19 May YEAR 22
In the end, I had to go to the Flowering Arboretum. I had quit telling myself the lie that I didn’t remember what happened there. I had to stop living in hiding in the hospital and stop having seizures. If I wanted to do that, I had to go to the place. With that intent, I went to the bus stop every day, but I couldn’t ride the bus to the arboretum.
Yoongi hyung came and sat next to me after I’d already let three buses go by. I asked what was up, and hyung said he was bored and had nothing to do. Then he asked why I was sitting here like this. I thought about why I was sitting here like this. It was because I had no courage. I wanted to pretend I was okay now, that I knew a little, that I surpassed it on my own, but in truth I was afraid. I was afraid that I might encounter something that I might not withstand, that I might have another seizure.
Yoongi hyung looked relaxed. He slumped down like had not a thing in the world to worry him, and said that the weather was nice, said all kinds of useless things. After I heard that, I realized the weather really was nice. I had been so worried that I didn’t bother looking at my surroundings. The sky was so blue. A warm breeze blew on occasion. From far off, the shuttle bus for the arboretum was coming. The bus stopped and the door opened. The driver looked at me. On impulse I spoke,
“Hyung, do you want to come with me?”
Taehyung
17 July YEAR 22
My side hurt so badly it seemed to be tearing. Sweat fell in drops. In the nooks and crannies of the railroad in the vacant lot behind the convenience store under the overpass- the girl was nowhere to be found. I had even run to the bus stop, but as expected I didn’t see her. The people waiting for their buses looked at me strangely. What had happened? We hadn’t promised to meet, but it was still strange. That girl always appeared from somewhere and followed me around. Even if I told her it was annoying, it was no use. But now she was nowhere to be found, even in the places we used to go together.
I came to a familiar wall and slowed my steps. There was graffiti there we had drawn together. It was the first thing she had ever drawn. On top of it there was a large ‘X’ drawn. It was her. I hadn’t seen her do it, but I knew. Why? There was no response. Instead, several after images overlapped on the wall.
Her laughing at me after I had lain down on the railroad tracks and hit my head. Her helping me up after I’d fallen trying to help her run away, her angry expression when we passed in front of a photo studio with a family photo in the window. Her gaze following the students we passed by, unbeknownst even to her. As we had sprayed this wall together I had said, “If you have a problem tell me about it, don’t just grumble to yourself.” The ‘X’ was drawn over all of those memories. It seemed like it was saying all of it was fake. I had made my hands into fists. Why? Of course there was no response. I kept walking. We were alone again. Me and her.
Taehyung
20 March YEAR 20
I slid down the hallway, my feet making noisy sounds. Then I stopped. I could see Namjoon standing in front of ‘our classroom’. Our classroom. Nobody knew this, but I called that place our classroom. Me and the hyungs and Jungkook, it was ours. I caught my breath and approached. I was going to startle them.
“Principal!” I had barely taken five steps when I head an urgent voice through the open classroom window. It seemed like Seokjin hyung. I stopped walking. Was Seokjin hyung talking to the principal right now? In our classroom? Why? Then I heard my name and Yoongi hyung’s and I saw Namjoon hyung draw in a startled breath. As if having sensed it, Seokjin hyung suddenly opened the door. There was a phone in Seokjin hyung’s hand. His shock and confusion was plain on his face. I couldn’t see Namjoon hyung’s expression. I hid and watched. Seokjin hyung looked confused. “Hyung must have had a reason.” After he spoke, Namjoon hyung passed by Seokjin hyung and went into the classroom. I couldn’t believe it. Seokjin hyung told the principal what Yoongi hyung and I had done for the last several days. He told everything, about skipping class and climbing over the wall and fighting with other kids. But Namjoon hyung said that was all okay.
“What are you doing here?” I turned around in shock. It was Hoseok hyung and Jimin. Hoseok hyung pretended to be even more shocked, then slung his arm over my shoulders. In a moment of confusion, I let Hoseok hyung pull me into that classroom. Namjoon hyung and Seokjin hyung were talking, and they looked up. Seokjin hyung got up in a hurry and said something had come up. He left the classroom. I looked at Namjoon hyung’s expression. He had watched Seokjin hyung’s retreating back, but now he laughed as if nothing was wrong. At that moment, a thought occurred to me. Namjoon hyung must have had a reason. Because hyung knew more than me, and was smarter and older. And because this was our classroom, I went into the classroom smiling the foolish smile that the others teasingly called my rectangle smile. I thought that I wouldn’t tell anyone else that I had overheard that conversation.
Jungkook
26 July YEAR 22
I sneakily broke a flower off the hospital’s wreath. I kept laughing and having to bow my head to hide it. The midsummer sunlight was blindingly bright. I knocked on the hospital room door, but there was no reply. I knocked again. No one was there. It was only full of a very quiet darkness.
I left the hospital room. I had met her here when I was bored and stifled and pushing my wheelchair like crazy up and down the hallway. She had appeared so suddenly that I barely had time to stop, and there she stood, a girl with her hair tied up in a ponytail. When I left the hospital I saw a bench. I remembered we had listened to music together and drawn, sitting there. I was still holding the wildflower in my hand, there was no one to give it to.
Jungkook
30 September YEAR 20
“Jeon Jungkook. You’re not still going there, are you?” I didn’t answer. I just stood there staring at the toes of my shoes. When I didn’t answer he hit me on the head with the attendance file. But even so, I didn’t open my mouth. It was the classroom I used with the hyungs. After the day I had followed the hyungs around and we had discovered that classroom. There wasn’t a single day I hadn’t gone. Maybe the hyungs didn’t know. Sometimes they didn’t come because they had other plans or were busy with part-time jobs. I hadn’t seen either Seokjin hyung or Yoongi hyung in a few days. But not me. I didn’t skip a single day. There were days when nobody came at all. But that's okay. Even if it wasn’t today, then they would come tomorrow, and if not tomorrow then the day after. It was okay.
“You only learned bad things following them around.” He hit me again. I lifted my gaze and looked at him. He hit me again. The image came to me of Yoongi hyung hitting me. I gritted my teeth and endured. I didn’t want to lie and say I hadn’t been going.
Now I was standing again in front of that classroom. It seemed like the hyungs would be there if I opened the door. It seemed like they would look up from the fame they were playing and ask me why I was so late. Seokjin hyung and Namjoon hyung would be reading books, Yoongi hyung would be playing the piano, and Hoseok hyung and Jimin hyung would be dancing.
But when I opened the door, only Hoseok hyung was there. He was cleaning up the things we had left behind in the classroom. I held the door handle and just stood there. Hyung came over and put his arm around my shoulders. Then he led me outside. “Let’s go.” The classroom door closed behind us. I suddenly realized: those days were gone and they would never return.

Well, I met an old man dying on a train
No more destination, no more pain
Well, he said one thing before I graduate
""Never let your fear decide your fate""

I say you kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause
Everybody will die
Every day we just
Go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry we
Love you more than you know

Well, the sun one day will leave us all behind
Unexplainable sightings in the sky
Well, I hate to be the one to ruin the night
Right before your, right before your eyes

I say you kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause
Everybody will die
Every day we just
Go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry we
Love you more than you know

Well, I met an old man dying on a train
No more destination, no more pain
Well, he said one thing before I graduate
""Never let your fear decide your fate""

I say you kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause
Everybody will die
Every day we just
Go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry we
Love you more than you know

I say you kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause
Everybody will die
Every day we just
Go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry we
Love you more than you know

Seokjin
30 August YEAR 22
Can anyone remember the moment they fall in love? Can anyone predict the moment their love will end? What could be the reason that humans don’t have the ability to recognize those moments? And why was I given the power to return all of those things?
The car came to a sudden stop, the headlights flash, crashing, bouncing, falling. I did nothing but stand defenseless in the face of all of those moments. I heard no sound and felt no sensations. It was summer, but the wind seemed cold. There was the sound of something tumbling along the street. Then there was the scent of flowers. Only then did a sense of reality come to me. The bouquet of Smeraldo flowers fell from my hand. She was laying there in the middle of the street. There was blood flowing in between the strands of her hair. The dark red blood flowers along the street. I thought, “If only I could turn back time.”
Seokjin
12 July YEAR 20
Past the school doors, the sound of cicadas prickled my ears. The school yard was crowded with kids laughing and playing and competing in races. It was the start of summer vacation and everyone was chattering. I ducked my head and walked in between them. I wanted to leave as quickly as I could.
“Hyung.” I lifted my head surprised by the sudden appearance of someone’s shoulder. It was Hoseok and Jimin. They looked at me, their smiles as wide and bright as ever and their eyes full of mischief. “Today is the start of vacation, are you still going to leave?” Hoseok asked tugging at my arm. I muttered, “sure,” and a few more meaningless words, then turned my head away. What had happened that day was clearly an accident. It wasn’t intentional. I hadn’t imagined that Jungkook and Yoongi would be in the storage room at that time. The principal suspected that I was covering for my dangsaengs. I had to say something. But in the end Yoongi had gotten expelled. Nobody knew that I had been the complicit.
“Have a good vacation hyung! I’ll call you.” Maybe having interpreted my expression, Hoseok let his hand drop slightly and forced an even brighter greeting. I couldn’t answer this time either. There was nothing I could say. As I passed the school gate, I thought of the first day I had come to this school. We had all been punished  for tardiness together. We could laugh because of it. I had ruined these moments.
Yoongi
15 June YEAR 22
I wasn't aware of anything other than the sound of music playing in my head. Not how much I had drunk, nor where I was, nor what I had been doing. I didn’t know, and it wasn’t important. When I went outside, stumbling, it was already night. I swayed as I walked. I bumped into pedestrians, news kiosks, walls. I didn’t care. I just wanted to forget everything.
Jimin’s voice was still ringing in my ears. “Hyung, Jungkook…” My next memory was of running like crazy up the hospital steps. The hospital hall had been strangely long and dark. I passed people wearing hospital gowns. My heart pounded. Everyone’s faces were too pale. They had no expressions. They all seemed like dead people. The sound of my breathing was harsh inside my own head.
Inside the slightly opened hospital room door, Jungkook was lying there. I turned my head without realizing it. I couldn’t look at him. At that moment I suddenly heard the sound of a piano, of flames, of a building crumbling down. I clutched my head and sank down. “This is your fault. If it wasn’t for you…” It was my mother’s voice- no my voice- no someone’s voice. At those words I was tormented by countless moments. I wanted to believe it wasn’t so. But Jungkook was lying there. Jungkook was lying in a hall full of corpse like patients passing by, I was utterly unable to go inside. I couldn’t check for myself. When I stood, my legs threatened to give out. I left with tears flowing. It was funny. I couldn’t even remember the last time I had cried.
I went to cross the street, but someone grabbed my arm and I came to a halt. Who was it? No, I didn’t care. No matter who it was, it was all the same. Don’t come near me. Go away. Just leave me be. I don’t want to hurt you either. I don’t want to be hurt. So please, don’t come any closer.
Yoongi
12 June YEAR 19
I thoughtlessly ditched school, but truthfully I didn’t have anywhere to go. It was hot. I had no money, and I had nothing to do. It was Namjoon who said we should go to the beach. The younger kids seemed excited, but I didn’t particularly feel like it, nor did I dislike the idea. “Do we have money?” At my question Namjoon made everyone shake out their pockets. A few coins, a few bills. “So we can’t go.” The one who said we could just walk was probably Taehyung. Namjoon made a face begging them to reconsider, but the kids just chattered away laughing and pretending to roll around on the road before starting to walk. I wasn’t in the mood to talk back so I just fell behind. It was midday, so even the gingko trees couldn’t provide shade, and the cars kicked up dust as they passed us on the sidewalkless road.
“Let’s go there.” It was Taehyung this time too. Or was it Hoseok? I didn’t care so I didn’t look carefully, but it would have been one of them. I had been walking along with my head down, kicking dirt. When I almost collided with someone I lifted my head. Jimin was standing there as if frozen in place. The muscles in his face trembled as if had seen something terrifying. He was staring at a sign that said “Flowering Arboretum, 2.2 kilometers.""
“I didn’t want to walk.” I heard Jungkook’s voice. Sweat dripped from Jimin’s face. He went pale, as if he might collapse at any second. What is it? I had a strange feeling. “Park Jimin.” I called, but as I expected he didn’t budge. I lifted my head again and looked at the sign.
“Hey, it’s so hot. Why would we go to an arboretum? Let’s go to the beach.” I said as if dragging my feet. I didn’t know what kind of place the arboretum was, but it didn’t seem like we should go. Whatever the reason, Jimin’s expression was strange. “We don’t even have money.” Hoseok replied. “That’s why we’re walking.” And Taehyung added, “If we just walk to the train station we can probably make it.” Then Namjoons said, “Instead we’ll just starve at dinner.” Jungkook and Taehyung pretended to cry, and Seokjin hyung laughed. Jimin only started to move again once it was decided that we would take the road toward the train station. Walking with his head down and his shoulders trembling, Jimin seemed like a small child. I looked up at the sign again. The characters spelling “Flowering Arboretum” were gradually getting further away.
Namjoon
13 July YEAR 22
I rested my head against the bus window. From the library to the gas station, the scenery passed by the window, almost frighteningly familiar since I took this route everyday. Would there come a day I could leave this scenery behind? I felt that it was impossible to predict what tomorrow would bring, nor to hope for anything.
There was a woman sitting in front of me, her hair tied with a yellow rubber band. Her shoulders lifted and then dropped as if she was sighing. Then she rested her head against the window. For around a month already, we had studied at the same library and gotten on the bus at the same stop. We hadn’t spoken a word to each other, but we looked at the same scenery and lived on the same time and sighed the same sighs. The hair tie was still in my pant’s pocket.
The woman always got off the bus three stops before I did. Every time I saw her leave, I wondered if she was going to distribute fliers. What kind of time was she spending, what kind of things was she enduring? How strongly did she feel stifled at the thought that tomorrow might not come, or that from the beginning there had never been such a thing as tomorrow? I thought things like that.
The woman’s stop began to approach. Someone pressed the stop request button and other passengers stood up from their seats. But in the midst of this, that woman didn’t stir. She just stayed in her seat, her head against the window. It seemed like she was asleep. Should I go and wake her? I fought with myself for a moment. The bus approached the stop. The woman didn’t move. People disembarked. The door closed and the bus started to move.
The woman didn’t wake, even as we passed the next three stops. As I moved to the bus door I fought with myself again. It was clear that once I got off the bus, no one else would pay attention to her. She would wake up somewhere far from her stop, and it was impossible to know how much more tired she would be today because of it.
I left the bus stop and started to walk toward the gas station. The bus took off and I didn’t look back. I had left the hair tie on top of her bag, but that was it. That wasn’t a beginning, and as such nor was it an end. It was nothing to start with and there was no reason for it to be anything. So I thought it really didn’t matter.
Namjoon
17 December YEAR 21
The people waiting for the bus rubbed their hands together in the cold. I looked down at the dirt, clutching the strap of my bag. I was trying to not make eye contact with anyone. It was a countryside village where only two buses stopped per day. From a distance, I saw the first bus approaching.
I boarded the bus behind everyone else. I didn’t look back. When I was passionate about something, when I barely had something in my grasp, when I had nothing left but things to escape- I had conditions. I wasn’t to look back. The moment I looked back the efforts I’d made until now became little more than seafoam. Looking back, that was a kind of suspicion, a kind of lingering attachment, and a kind of fear. Only when I had overcome these things could I finally escape.
The bus started off. I had no plans. I had nothing I was passionate about, nothing in my group, no particular reason to escape. It was closer to thoughtlessly running away from my mother’s tired face, my wandering sibling, my father’s illness. Starting with the situation in our house that grew more difficult with every passing day, from my family, who enforced sacrifice and tranquility, and from me who pretended to know nothing and restrained myself from trying to adjust and grow resigned. But most of all it was closer to running from poverty.
If anyone asked if it’s a crime to be poor, everyone would say it’s not. But is that really the truth? Poverty gnaws on so many things. Things that were precious become meaningless. You give up things you can’t give up. You grow suspicious and fearful and resigned.
The bus would arrive at a familiar stop in a few hours. When I left from that place a year ago I had left no message behind. And now I was returning with no sign or warning. I tried to recall my friend’s faces. I had cut off contact with all of them. What were they all doing these days? Would they be glad to see me? Would we be able to get together and laugh the way we had back then? There was frost on the windows and I couldn’t see the scenery outside. On top of the frost, I slowly moved my finger.
“I have to survive.”
Hoseok
4 July YEAR 22
I stood in the hallway the whole time she was receiving first aid. Even though it was night, the hospital hallway was bustling with people. Moisture dripped from my hair, wet with sweat and rain. I dropped the bag I had taken off of her. A variety of things tumbled out of it. A few coins rolled away, and a ball pen and a towel. In the middle of it all was an airplane e-ticket. I picked it up and scanned it.
At that moment, the doctor called me. He said it was a mild concussion and nothing to worry about, and after a moment, she came out as well. “Are you okay?” She said that her head just hurt a little, and she took her bag from me. Then she spotted the e-ticket peeking out, and looked up at my face. I shifted my bag to my other shoulder and said that we should go, pretending that it was nothing. As we left the hospital it was raining as hard as ever. We stood side by side outside the door.
“Hoseok-ah” she said. It looked like she had something to say. “Wait a second. I’ll get an umbrella.” I ran off thoughtlessly into the rain. There was a convenience store in the distance. I knew that she had auditioned for an overseas dance team some time ago. The plane ticket meant that she had made it. I didn’t want to hear her say it. I didn’t have the confidence to congratulate her.
Hoseok
23 July YEAR 10
When I counted to three, I heard the sound of laughter like a hallucination. The next moment the young me passed by holding someone’s hand. I looked back quickly, but there was no one there except my classmates staring at me. “Hoseok-ah,” the teacher called my name. Only then did I realize where I was. It was a class field trip. I was counting the fruits that were drawn in the textbook. Five. Six. I kept counting, but as I did my voice trembled and my hands grew sweaty. The memory of that time kept surfacing.
I couldn’t clearly remember my mother’s face that day. I only remembered the chocolate bar she gave me as we looked around the amusement park. “Hoseok-ah. Count to ten and then open your eyes.” When I had finished counting and opened my eyes, my mother was gone. I waited and waited, but she never returned. I had only counted to nine. If I counted one more it would have been fine, but my voice wouldn’t come out. My ears were ringing and my surroundings grew cloudy. The teacher kept pointing, telling me to keep counting. My friends were staring at me. I couldn’t remember my mother’s face. It seemed like if I counted one more, my mother would really never come back for me.
Just like that, I collapsed to the ground.
Jimin
4 July YEAR 22
By the time I returned to my senses, I had washed my arm so much that I was losing skin. My hands were trembling and I was short of breath. My eyes were bloodshot. What had just happened came back to me in fragments.
For a moment I had lost focus. I was dancing with a noona from the dance club, a collaborative dance, but I had lost my flow and we collided. I fell to the rough floor and my arm started to bleed. At that moment I had remembered what happened at the Flowering Arboretum. I thought that I had overcome it. But that wasn’t the case. I had to run away. I had to wash it away. I had to look away. The me in the mirror was the same eight-year-old kid who had run away in the rain. Then all at once I realized. Noona had fallen down too.
There was nothing I could do. All I could do was fall and hurt someone, leave them behind, and tremble at my own pain only to run after them too late with an umbrella before stopping. Every time I took a step rainwater soaked my sneakers. Car headlights passes me by. It wasn’t okay. No it was okay. It didn’t hurt. It wasn’t that serious of an injury. I was really okay.
Jimin
19 May YEAR 22
In the end, I had to go to the Flowering Arboretum. I had quit telling myself the lie that I didn’t remember what happened there. I had to stop living in hiding in the hospital and stop having seizures. If I wanted to do that, I had to go to the place. With that intent, I went to the bus stop every day, but I couldn’t ride the bus to the arboretum.
Yoongi hyung came and sat next to me after I’d already let three buses go by. I asked what was up, and hyung said he was bored and had nothing to do. Then he asked why I was sitting here like this. I thought about why I was sitting here like this. It was because I had no courage. I wanted to pretend I was okay now, that I knew a little, that I surpassed it on my own, but in truth I was afraid. I was afraid that I might encounter something that I might not withstand, that I might have another seizure.
Yoongi hyung looked relaxed. He slumped down like had not a thing in the world to worry him, and said that the weather was nice, said all kinds of useless things. After I heard that, I realized the weather really was nice. I had been so worried that I didn’t bother looking at my surroundings. The sky was so blue. A warm breeze blew on occasion. From far off, the shuttle bus for the arboretum was coming. The bus stopped and the door opened. The driver looked at me. On impulse I spoke,
“Hyung, do you want to come with me?”
Taehyung
17 July YEAR 22
My side hurt so badly it seemed to be tearing. Sweat fell in drops. In the nooks and crannies of the railroad in the vacant lot behind the convenience store under the overpass- the girl was nowhere to be found. I had even run to the bus stop, but as expected I didn’t see her. The people waiting for their buses looked at me strangely. What had happened? We hadn’t promised to meet, but it was still strange. That girl always appeared from somewhere and followed me around. Even if I told her it was annoying, it was no use. But now she was nowhere to be found, even in the places we used to go together.
I came to a familiar wall and slowed my steps. There was graffiti there we had drawn together. It was the first thing she had ever drawn. On top of it there was a large ‘X’ drawn. It was her. I hadn’t seen her do it, but I knew. Why? There was no response. Instead, several after images overlapped on the wall.
Her laughing at me after I had lain down on the railroad tracks and hit my head. Her helping me up after I’d fallen trying to help her run away, her angry expression when we passed in front of a photo studio with a family photo in the window. Her gaze following the students we passed by, unbeknownst even to her. As we had sprayed this wall together I had said, “If you have a problem tell me about it, don’t just grumble to yourself.” The ‘X’ was drawn over all of those memories. It seemed like it was saying all of it was fake. I had made my hands into fists. Why? Of course there was no response. I kept walking. We were alone again. Me and her.
Taehyung
20 March YEAR 20
I slid down the hallway, my feet making noisy sounds. Then I stopped. I could see Namjoon standing in front of ‘our classroom’. Our classroom. Nobody knew this, but I called that place our classroom. Me and the hyungs and Jungkook, it was ours. I caught my breath and approached. I was going to startle them.
“Principal!” I had barely taken five steps when I head an urgent voice through the open classroom window. It seemed like Seokjin hyung. I stopped walking. Was Seokjin hyung talking to the principal right now? In our classroom? Why? Then I heard my name and Yoongi hyung’s and I saw Namjoon hyung draw in a startled breath. As if having sensed it, Seokjin hyung suddenly opened the door. There was a phone in Seokjin hyung’s hand. His shock and confusion was plain on his face. I couldn’t see Namjoon hyung’s expression. I hid and watched. Seokjin hyung looked confused. “Hyung must have had a reason.” After he spoke, Namjoon hyung passed by Seokjin hyung and went into the classroom. I couldn’t believe it. Seokjin hyung told the principal what Yoongi hyung and I had done for the last several days. He told everything, about skipping class and climbing over the wall and fighting with other kids. But Namjoon hyung said that was all okay.
“What are you doing here?” I turned around in shock. It was Hoseok hyung and Jimin. Hoseok hyung pretended to be even more shocked, then slung his arm over my shoulders. In a moment of confusion, I let Hoseok hyung pull me into that classroom. Namjoon hyung and Seokjin hyung were talking, and they looked up. Seokjin hyung got up in a hurry and said something had come up. He left the classroom. I looked at Namjoon hyung’s expression. He had watched Seokjin hyung’s retreating back, but now he laughed as if nothing was wrong. At that moment, a thought occurred to me. Namjoon hyung must have had a reason. Because hyung knew more than me, and was smarter and older. And because this was our classroom, I went into the classroom smiling the foolish smile that the others teasingly called my rectangle smile. I thought that I wouldn’t tell anyone else that I had overheard that conversation.
Jungkook
26 July YEAR 22
I sneakily broke a flower off the hospital’s wreath. I kept laughing and having to bow my head to hide it. The midsummer sunlight was blindingly bright. I knocked on the hospital room door, but there was no reply. I knocked again. No one was there. It was only full of a very quiet darkness.
I left the hospital room. I had met her here when I was bored and stifled and pushing my wheelchair like crazy up and down the hallway. She had appeared so suddenly that I barely had time to stop, and there she stood, a girl with her hair tied up in a ponytail. When I left the hospital I saw a bench. I remembered we had listened to music together and drawn, sitting there. I was still holding the wildflower in my hand, there was no one to give it to.
Jungkook
30 September YEAR 20
“Jeon Jungkook. You’re not still going there, are you?” I didn’t answer. I just stood there staring at the toes of my shoes. When I didn’t answer he hit me on the head with the attendance file. But even so, I didn’t open my mouth. It was the classroom I used with the hyungs. After the day I had followed the hyungs around and we had discovered that classroom. There wasn’t a single day I hadn’t gone. Maybe the hyungs didn’t know. Sometimes they didn’t come because they had other plans or were busy with part-time jobs. I hadn’t seen either Seokjin hyung or Yoongi hyung in a few days. But not me. I didn’t skip a single day. There were days when nobody came at all. But that's okay. Even if it wasn’t today, then they would come tomorrow, and if not tomorrow then the day after. It was okay.
“You only learned bad things following them around.” He hit me again. I lifted my gaze and looked at him. He hit me again. The image came to me of Yoongi hyung hitting me. I gritted my teeth and endured. I didn’t want to lie and say I hadn’t been going.
Now I was standing again in front of that classroom. It seemed like the hyungs would be there if I opened the door. It seemed like they would look up from the fame they were playing and ask me why I was so late. Seokjin hyung and Namjoon hyung would be reading books, Yoongi hyung would be playing the piano, and Hoseok hyung and Jimin hyung would be dancing.
But when I opened the door, only Hoseok hyung was there. He was cleaning up the things we had left behind in the classroom. I held the door handle and just stood there. Hyung came over and put his arm around my shoulders. Then he led me outside. “Let’s go.” The classroom door closed behind us. I suddenly realized: those days were gone and they would never return.

Thank you Mr. Secretary General, UNICEF executive directors, and all the distinguished guests from across the world.
My name is Kim Namjoon, also known as RM, the leader of the group, BTS. It is an incredible honor to be invited to an occasion of such significance for today's young generation.
Last November, BTS launched the Love Myself campaign with UNICEF built on our belief that true love first begins with loving yourself. We are partnering with UNICEF in the End Violence program to protect children and young people from all over the world from violence. And our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their actions and with their enthusiasm. We truly have the best fans in the world.
And I’d like to begin by talking about myself. I was born in Ilsan, a city near Seoul, South Korea. It is a really beautiful place with a lake, hills, and even an annual flower festival. I spent a very happy childhood there, and I was just an ordinary boy. I used to look up at the night sky and wonder, and I used to dream the dreams of a boy. I used to imagine that I was a super hero who could save the world.
In an intro to one of our early albums, there’s a line that says, ‘My heart stopped when I was maybe nine or ten.’ Looking back, I think that’s when I began to worry about what other people thought of me, and started seeing myself through their eyes. I stopped looking up at the night skies, the stars. I stopped daydreaming. Instead, I just tried to jam myself into the molds that other people made. Soon, I began to shut out my own voice, and started to listen to the voices of others.
No one called out my name, and neither did I. My heart stopped, and my eyes closed shut. So, like this, I, we, all lost our names. We became like ghosts.
But I had one sanctuary, and that was music. There was a small voice inside of me that said, ‘Wake up, man, and listen to yourself.’ But it took me quiet a long time to hear music calling my real name. Even after making the decision to join BTS, there were a lot of hurdles. Some people may not believe, but most people thought we were hopeless. Sometimes I just wanted to quit. But I think I was very lucky that I didn’t give it all up. And I’m sure that I, and we, will keep stumbling and falling like this.
BTS has become artists performing in those huge stadiums and selling millions of albums right now, but I am still an ordinary 24-year-old guy. If there’s anything that I've achieved, it was only possible that I have my other BTS members right by my side, and because of the love and support that our ARMY fans all over the world make for us.
And maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday’s me is still me. Today, I am who I am with all of my faults and my mistakes. Tomorrow, I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that’ll be me too. These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to love myself for who I am, for who I was, and for who I hope to become.
I’d like to say one last thing: After releasing our Love Yourself albums and launching the ‘Love Myself’ campaign, we started to hear remarkable stories from our fans all over the world. How our message helped them overcome their hardships in life and start loving themselves. Those stories constantly remind us of our responsibility.
So let’s take all one more step. We have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to speak yourself.
I’d like to ask all of you, What is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat? Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin color, your gender identity, just speak yourself.
Find your name and find your voice by speaking yourself.
I’m Kim Namjoon, and also RM of BTS. I am an idol, and I am an artist from a small town in Korea. Like most people, I’ve made many and plenty mistakes in my life. I have many faults, and I have many more fears, but I’m going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I’m starting to love myself gradually, just little by little.
What is your name?
Speak yourself.
Thank you very much.

Letra de ""Asesina""
Se oyen rumores en las calles de que yo te ando llorando
Y si la gente supiera que en verdad eres tu la que me andas rogando
Yo por ser un buen caballero mejor me quede callado
Y ahora voy a revelar lo que un tal cupido a mi me había regalado

Me regalo una asesina
Una asesina que mata el amor
Con un secreto de envenenador
De mis tormentos fuiste el peor
Y me salio una asesina
Una asesina que juega a matar
Por donde voy no te quiero encontrar
Tu en una cárcel mereces estar
Y tu eres la responsable de que yo no pueda querer
Ni si quiera tu sombra la quiero ver

He puesto una restricción en contra de tu maldad
Yo espero que algún día te des cuenta de que tu eres una vergüenza para la sociedad
Yo por ser un buen caballero no escuche lo que decían
Que tu eres una caja de sorpresa y de angelito, inocente tu te vestías

Me regalo una asesina
Una asesina que mata el amor
Con un secreto de envenenador
De mis tormentos fuiste el peor
Y me salio una asesina
Una asesina que juega a matar
Por donde voy no te quiero encontrar
Tu en una cárcel mereces estar
Y tu eres la responsable de que yo no pueda querer
Ni si quiera tu sombra la quiero ver

Ah
Zacarias Ferreira

Y me salio una asesina
Una asesina que mata el amor
Con un secreto de envenenador
De mis tormentos fuiste el peor
Y tu eres la responsable de que yo no pueda querer
Ni si quiera tu sombra la quiero ver

Letra de “Donde Estan Esos Amigos Amigos”
Con sentimiento
El Chaval
Bienve Ortíz, en esta ocasión esto no va para usted

Decían mis amigos “Somos tus amigos
Por toda la vida te seremos fiel”
Me sentía halagado y muy superado
Casi mi fortuna con ellos gaste
Surgieron problemas en mi economía
Por un corto tiempo desapareci
Y aquellas palabras que tanto decían
Ahora me doy cuenta que no eran haci

Donde estan esos amigos que me decían
Que en la buenas y en la malas conmigo estarían
Que cosas tiene la vida, todo era mentira
Porque de mí se alejaron cuando yo caía
Y sólo me quedo uno que me sonreía
Y sólo me quedo uno por toda la vida

Si señor
Es lamentable el caso
Comprender, cuando se hace leña del árbol caído
Pero con fe en Dios
Oye Ruben, mucho cariño mi hermano
El Chaval
Oye esa guitarra

Una y mil mujeres de mi compañía
Me daban placeres y me divertían
Producto de todo lo que yo tenía
Pero en realidad nunca fueron mías
Escuchen señores, esta triste historia
Que por este medio hoy les canto yo
No es algo ficticios, es un realismo
De algo muy serio que me sucedió
Los amigo y mujeres que me divertían
Todos me lo celebraban cuando yo tenía
Pero al verme en decadencia todo los perdía
Y sólo me quedo uno por toda la vida
Y sólo me quedo uno por toda la vida

Que tristeza de la vida
Y solo me quedo uno por toda la vida

Zacarias Ferreira!
Para ti!
Hoy recuerdo tu amor
Como lo que fue muy grande
Me diste tode de ti
Se que no podre olvidarte
Nunca he podido borrarlo
Tu dulce imagen de mi mente
Y anelo volverte a encontrar
Para vivir
Nuestro Amor de ayer
Porque diste a mi vida
La felicidad
Cuando te bese
Por primera vez
Y la gente logro
Con todas sus mentiras
Separarte de mi
Destrozando mi vida
Hoy le pido yo a dios
Volverte a encontrar
Porque nos merecemos
Otra oportunidad
Para irnos bien lejos
Y podernos amar
Donde la gente Mala
No nos pueda encontrar
Y Amarte
Amarte sin fin
Y ya nunca podran
Separarte de mi
Y Amarte
Amarte sin fin
Y ya nunca podran
Separarte de mi

Zacarias Ferreira!
Un cario para ti!
Que bello fue
Amarnos
Aunque el destino
Nos separo
Hoy vivo triste
Sin ti Amor
Recordando tu calor
Pero si Dios
Lo quiere asi
Que ya jamas
Yo te vuelva a ver
Te deseo
Con mucho Amor
Que seas feliz
Muy feliz mujer
Porque diste a mi vida
La felicidad
Cuando te bese
Por primera vez
Y la gente logro
Con todas sus mentiras

Oye!! Se solto teodoro
Me duele el alma por esa ingrata esta sufriendo mi corazonsito
Esa malvada es la culpable que estoy muriendo poquito a poquito
Esta sangrando mi pobre alma de ver mi mami con ese otro tipo
Por un papel que hizo con el es que mi mami no me da besitos
No me conosco y yo no se quien soy con esta angustia no podre vivir
Con la agonia que hay en mi interior estoy tan loco que no se de mi
Es que su amor esta clavado en mi pecho y cada dia sangra mas mi herida que ni yo mismo muchas veces aunque quiero
Es que sin ella mi alma esta perdida
No me molesten dejen que beba a ver si un dia de un jumo me muero
Que nadie llore y en ves de flores lleven me romo para el cementerio
No quiero llantos sobre mi tumba, cerveza y romo es lo que quiero por que el que muere por lo que quiere debe la muerte saberle a cielo
No me conosco y yo no se quien soy con esta angustia no podre vivir

If you need a friend
Don’t look to a stranger

I’ll always be there
But when you’re in doubt
And when you’re in danger
Take a look all around

But if you wait around a while, I’ll make you fall for me

And so is your temper
You know what to do
I’m gonna always be there

It’s not what’s intended

Amare é dire la cosa che
Tu non diresti mai
Amare é camminare con lei
Per l'eternita
Amare é quando resto e penso
Dove sarai
Amare é quando non capisci
Piu cosa fai

Amare é quando la proteggi
Dalla pioggia dal vento
Amare é tu l'abbracci
E dimentichi il tempo
Amare é quando tu la pensi
E non riesci a mangiare
Amare é quando lei ti racconta
E ti va di ascoltare

Per amarti ti verrei a cercare
Al confini del mare
Per amarti chiederei alla sera
Di poterti sfiorare
Per amarti legherei alla pioggia
Anche il fuoco ... io
Per amarti ti dare la mia vita ...
...solo per baciarti

Amare é quando scrivi il suo nome
E ti trema la mono
Amare é quando sogni soltanto
Di portarla lontano
Amare é quando tu la vedi
E ritrovi i suoi occhi

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to looking like his
When momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
Said somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bars
See more your friends than you do your kids
I always hoped for better
That maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

So remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

Oh how is it that I could come out to here and be still floating
And never hit bottom and keep falling through
Just relaxed and paying attention
All my two dimensional boundaries were gone
I had lost to them badly
I saw the world crumble and thought I was dead
But I found my senses still working
And as I continued to drop thru the hole
I found all the surrounding
Who showed me the joy that innocently is
Just be quiet and feel it around you
And I opened my heart to the whole universe
And I found it was loving
And I saw the great blunder my teacher's had made
Scientific delirium madness
I will keep falling as long as I live
All without ending
And I will remember the place that is now
That has ended before the beginning

Se-x
Mi cuerpo extraña tu piel (ah)
Y ese aroma que dejaste en mí impregnado
Hace que quiera volvértelo a hacer (baby)
Derramaste tanto sudor en mi cama
Fueron testigos las paredes y las almohadas
De esos besos que en la oscuridad te daba (mua)
Siempre respondía a todas tus llamadas (mami linda)
Pa' eso y otras cosas más tú me buscabas a mí

Quiero volver a explorar tu cuerpo
Ver tu cara cuando lo tengas adentro
Motivate, utilizame, dime cuando te vuelvo a ver
Pa' hacértelo como te lo hice ayer
Quiero volver a explorar tu cuerpo
Ver tu cara cuando lo tengas adentro
Motivate, utilizame, dime cuando te vuelvo a ver
Pa' hacértelo como te lo hice ayer

Echamos un polvo, echamos dos
Tú eres mi diosa, yo soy tu Dios
Siguió la noche y echamos tres
Conmigo se te quito el estrés
Mirame a la cara y dime que ves
Mi cuerpo quiere algo de ti
Yo no sé que es, pero sé que si
Hay algo que me atrae de ti, de ti
Por eso quiero verte y tenerte aquí

Quiero volver a explorar tu cuerpo
Ver tu cara cuando lo tengas adentro
Motivate, utilizame, dime cuando te vuelvo a ver

Quiero volver a explorar tu cuerpo
Ver tu cara cuando lo tengas adentro

Hace tiempo quería
Meterte como te lo metí aquel día
Hablándote malo mientras te venías
Baby tengo cienes
Pero chingando tú eres quién la tiene
Traigo una libra de kush
Pa' que enrole y la quemé
Me acuerdo de la otra vez
Cuando te dí en todas las poses y en cuatro te grabe
Desde que me pegue
Me clavo todos los culos que salen en la TV
Pero tú estás más dura
Te hiciste el culo, las tetas y la cintura
Contigo me voy acapella sin armadura
No te hagas la difícil y dime que si
Ya tú me conoces y a ti te metí
El snapchat que enviaste ya lo vi
Me gusto y lo repetí

Te fuiste conmigo, sin miedo lo hicimos
Nos devoramos, más nos comimos
Llevo tres días en cautiverio contigo
Llevo tres días venciendo el peligro
Devorándote sigo y no voy a parar
Llega sin panty y déjate llevar
Se le moja ese toto conmigo
Y en su mismo cuarto la pongo a gritar
Una nave espacial, no estoy pa' bucear
Es algo especial, una baby social
Nalgas demasiadas, la saco a pasear
Se quiere iniciar y no es artificial
Te conocí y chingamos el mismo día
Jalamos a tu amiga e hicimos una orgía
Desde el momento ahora estas crecida
Pero yo fui el que rompí todas las averías

Quiero volver a explorar tu cuerpo
Ver tu cara cuando lo tengas adentro
Motivate, utilizame, dime cuando te vuelvo a ver
Pa' hacértelo como te lo hice ayer
Quiero volver a explorar tu cuerpo
Ver tu cara cuando lo tengas adentro
Motivate, utilizame, dime cuando te vuelvo a ver
Pa' hacértelo como te lo hice ayer

Gata te invito
Te quito lo visto
En cuatro como tú no he visto
De ese culo soy adicto
Que rico lo mueves
Si así es el cielo que me lleve cristo
Y si tú quieres, yo quiero
Vuelve para romperte ese crico
Todavía recuerdo tu ropa interior
Cuando fumas los ojos te cambian de color
En mi ropa Versace se quedo tu olor
Esta vez será mejor que la anterior

Anda ve a decirle que yo estoy sufriendo
Dile que no puedo con las penas
Tú que te das cuenta que la quiero
Ve a decirle que mi alma se quema
Tú que eres su amiga y sabes de mis sueños
Cuéntale que el mundo se me acaba
Vamos date cuenta que me muero
Que sin ella no soy nada
Ve y dile que mi vida sólo es vida si ella está
Que no soporto más esta terrible soledad
Que me la encuentro siempre en cada sueño
Que ya no duermo
Que si miro al espejo su reflejo encuentro allí
Que pronuncio su nombre y nada quiero decir
Que allí está su risa en mis recuerdos
Que ya estoy casi enloqueciendo
Dile que aquí está el hombre que la ama
Que siempre ha sido el dueño de su vida
Que siempre hay una lágrima en mi cara
Que ya no puedo más con las heridas
Háblale, dile que yo he sentido engañarla
Que se acaba mi vida
Que se muere mi alma, dile...
Que vuelva, a decir que aún me puede amar
Pero que vuelva a mí
Que sin ella no puedo vivir
Anda ve a decirle que no hay un segundo
Que no me hagan falta sus caricias
Que me hacen daño los minutos
Que deliro por su sonrisa
Anda ve a decirle que más primaveras
No veré llegar si no regresa
Que si las miradas no me llegan
Sé que pierdo la cabeza
Dile que no hay un instante donde no piense en su piel
Que me muero de angustia porque yo no la puedo ver
Y pierdo mil intentos en buscarla
Y no me habla
Que aunque rompí su foto aún su imagen sigue ahí
Clavada en mi memoria y no se puede salir
Que está en cada rincón de nuestra casa
Que su recuerdo casi me mata
Dile que aquí está el hombre que la ama
Que siempre ha sido el dueño de su vida
Que siempre hay una lágrima en mi cara
Que ya no puedo más con las heridas

Dicen que es la gloria que es un don divino que lo inpuso Dios
Y yo me pregunto si eso es tan hermoso porque tengo que sufrir
Si yo te amo tanto dime las razones porque no me amas a mi
Si yo te entrego el ama en cada beso que doy porque me traciona
Sera que la vida no aguardo para mi un amor verdadero

No pierdo la esperanza de un dia escuchar que yo soy tu dueño
No pierdo la esperanza de un dia me diga""te quiero""

Hoy te vi pasar
Hoy la vi pasar
Y sin querer se apoderaron de m
Antiguos sentimientos
Y yo pens que no existan en m
Que estaban ms que muertos
Tanto tiempo
Hoy la vi pasar
Sent algo extrao
Que no puedo explicar
A menos que lo quiera
Que la sangre me quemaba la piel
Corriendo por mis venas
Que condena ayyyyyyyy
Y record todos los buenos momentos
Que viv a su lado
Cuando mi cielo lo lleno de estrellas
Con sus huellas ayyyyyyyyy
Y record todo lo triste y lo malo
Que pase contigo
Que fue por ella todo lo que he sufrido
Con su olvido hoy
Hoy la vi pasar
Y me di cuenta que jams la olvide
Que todava la quiero
Que esta en mi vida
Que no puedo olvidar
Que no soy de acero
Y no puedo
Hoy la vi pasar
Y sin querer se apoderaron de m

Y yo pens que no existan en m
Que estaban ms que muertos

The technique is ill son, watch how I spill one
Peace to Biggie, 2Pac, Big L and Big Pun
Havoc on the streets of Staten, snitches
House niggas, children watch as they produce the same pattern
Somebody raped our women, murdered our babies
Hit us with the cracks and guns in the early 80's
For those that murdered me shall stand before God
To fall at the hands of fate, then out comes the rod
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

What the fuck is going on, I can't go to sleep
Feds jumping out their jeeps, I can't go to sleep
Babies with flies on they cheeks, it's hard to go to sleep
Ish bowled two 6's twice, I couldn't go to sleep
Aiyyo we deep in the stairs, we carry big guns
Whippy got hit up with the big shit, bong bong
Stop at the cheeba spot, then pass the leak spot
Drove past y'all niggas again, you took a cheap shot
Not knowing, fucking with me you get your meat chopped
You thought we fell on our face, you need to be stopped
Call on the chariots, call on an ambulance
You better smile, my nigga you on Candid Cam
Gangsta broad, these be the laws, walk with big balls
Nigga, motherfucking eunuch, I even take which was yours
I'm the nigga that made you, man
When your rap wasn't doing well I'm the nigga that gave you a hand

Don't kill your brother, learn to love each other
Don't get mad, cause it ain't that bad
Look at who you are, you've come too far
It's in your hands, just be a man
Get the jelly out your spine
Cobwebs out of your mind

I can't go to sleep, I can't shut my eyes
They shot the father at his mom's building seven times
They shot Malcolm in the chest, front of his little seeds
Jesse watched as they shot King on the balcony
Exported Marcus Garvey cause he tried to spark us
With the knowledge of ourselves and our forefathers
Oh Jacqueline you heard the rifle shots crackling
Her husband's head in her hands, you tried to put it back in
America's watching, blood-stained ink blotches
Medgar took one to the skull for integrating college
What's the science? Somebody? This is trick knowledge
They try to keep us enslaved and still scrape for dollars
Walking through Park Hill, drunk as a fuck
Looking around like these Devils
I'm ready to break this world down
They got me trapped up in a metal gate
Just stressed out with hate
And just give me no time to relax and use my mind to meditate
What should I do, grab a blunt or a brew
Grab a .22 and run out there and put this fucking violence in you
I can't go to sleep, I can't shut em, son, I-

Don't let the game make you lose your head
You should be calling the shots instead
The power is in your hands
Stop all this crying and be a man

I think I'm goin' crazy

I think I'm goin' crazy, losin' my mind
I see elephants all of the time, I'm goin' loco
I think I'm losin' my mind, goin' crazy (I'm goin' loco)
Feel like I'm flyin' on a spaceship (Smoke Acapulco)
Speech gone, elephants kinda got my tongue (I'm goin' loco)
We ain't goin' home 'til the motherfuckin' sun

Up all night on this road
Feels like my head is gonna explode
Vision all fucked up, man, I'm gone
Dead in the middle of the twilight zone
Losin' my mind, so high, no lie
Can't tell if I'm in a dream, my, oh my
If I die tonight, I'ma get high tonight
Not sure I'll survive the night
Now I sweat, can't see straight
Now I start to hallucinate
Still way so crazed, you know it now
If you come at me, better slow it down
I'm about to snap, don't come close
Got a strap on the lap, ratta-tat-tat
Po-Po's comin', I'm on the run
With sun on my back and my elephant lungs
If I see another one, grab my elephant gun
If you can't see, it's irrelevant, son
""He's so insane,"" that's what they say
""He hit that bong too hard one day""

We ain't goin' home 'til the mother fuckin' sun
I think I'm losin' my mind, goin' crazy
Feel like I'm flyin' on a space ship
Speech is gone, elephant's kinda got my tongue
We ain't goin' home 'til the motherfuckin' sun

Burn my clutch, brain got stuck
Somethin' ain't right, I can feel it in my gut
Don't ask me 'cause I don't know
Where I came from or where's my home
If I seem uptight, you ain't wrong
I'm 'bout to start swingin' and droppin' bombs
Got that stare, you know which one
One that says, ""I kill you for fun""
Nigga went nuts, what the f-

It's another one of them ol' funky Cypress Hill things
YouknowhatI'msayin?
And it goes like thisss...

Hey don't miss out on what you're passin'
You're missin', the hoota of the funky Buddha
Eluder of your fucked up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
Cause we're like the outlaw stridin', when suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when they see me drivin'
By, hangin' out the window
And my Magnum takin' out some putos
Actin' kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from from the street gettin' paid from my vocals

I'm ignorin' all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is comin' from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around
My gat straight hummin'
Hummin'... comin' at cha...
And you know I had to gat ya

Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shinin' a battle light
Sen got the gat, and I know that'll gat ya right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man!
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said ""Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed-out
How you like my chrome?"" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast out, but I did anyway...
Hahaha... that young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man!

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite ya with insights
And if you ain't down: bullshit!
Say some punk try to get you for your auto
Would you call the one-time, play the role model?
No, I think you play like a thug
Next ya hear the shot of a Magnum slug
Hummin', comin' at cha
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gat ya
So how do ya know where I'm at, when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here riskin' my dome
Just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, ay yo I gotta say ""fuck it""

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one

I'm a bad mother, shut your mouth
Insanity, DVD, how I stretch 'em out
What the stress about? INS best out
Fact, you knew that before he left the house
Fresh at the produce section
Gaze at my shine like a showroom necklace
Death wish, stepping in Deck's direction
I'm checking niggas like test questions

Across 110th now, cross Belmont and Montauk
Camera hawk hawks the sidewalk
When they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you
Hustlers do you, gave you your first toolie
Cutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf
Think graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape
Anything of pulse and heroin
Emcees frozen, cuban link chains are golden
I'm owning everywhere I'm holding it up, to keep it raw
Math here, I got 'em keep coming back for more

Yo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up
Y'all don't want the drama, word up
The Wu first up, the game is the world versus us
Y'all was good 'til the world heard us
Y'all ain't want them Clan birds up
Y'all don't want your man served up, that'll get the fans worked up
Homie really wanna play, stir it up
I'ma catch me a wave, surfs up
Gliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this
Make me wanna smack that trick
Make a killer really wanna yap that kid
If he opens up his yap that's it

We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one

Mass of minerals in a glass house
Playing 4th the Wu neutrinos will blast out
Letting out verbal thunder bolts
Until the world attract old and younger folks
Charge with the vitality of magnetism
In large reality with massive rhythm
The manual without technical part
From the beginning give off an electrical spark

I respect you if you respect me
Everything's for real, WTC
No fake ass shit, don't front the Remy
Break bread, never have pockets empty
Let's get it, flip it up then we can spend it
The money train, Killa Beez on your brain
W's everywhere, one on your chain
Homeboys for life, please don't change
You can hide at my house, it ain't no thing
If you see the pigs, don't say jack
Call me original, don't say cap
I'm on the low, might be at the murder
Holding off the place y'all cats never heard of
Yeah, chicks wanna peep me out
Nasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth
But now I'm out, about to link with sticks

We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one

Bang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode
Forget the street codes, show you like a deep throat
It gets rougher, you suffer from the heat stroke
Blast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke
Park Hillians radio for back up
Polish your act up, nigga need a back up
Syrup in my cup, no cut, straight up
UG's on the court, never miss a lay up

When the emcees came to live out their names
Some rode the bus, some rode the train
Some motherfuckers wish they never came
When they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang
Nine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard
Body, the party is filled with Godbody
There out of shape models coming through with those bottles
And double D's please, all eyes follow
Pass me a bucket of ice, that's nice
Hit with the vodka, what you say proper
I drink with the copper, show up in a chopper
Stop her, she wanna have a ménage à trois
I can tell by the bra, RZA Ra-KZA-Keem is all is Allah
Do you wish or wish upon a star? Do you wish or wish upon a star?

Might even make a baby, the thesis makin' her crazy
She know my style wavy, I'm circlin' her Mercedes
Father, father was a preacher, I'm almost certain he hates me
But he ain't gotta date me and look, his baby is grown
And she decides on her own who resides on the throne
I'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone
And she understands the fact that I'm even right when I'm wrong
When she was prayin' in church, I was playin' in dirt
That's 100, I admit that we both was playin' at first
When opposites attract, I ain't always sayin' it works
I'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse
It's Wu-Tang, baby, my crew bang
And she's the preacher's daughter, I just call her my boo thang
And we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands
Man, sometimes I tell your parents just don't understand

No. yo, you mean Pastor Brown's daughter?
The preacher, the rich slave-maker of the poorer?
I used to see her Sundays comin' from church
We used to kick it at her window when her pops at work
Yo, her parents didn't play
She couldn't even come out to play on a school day
Thought she was gonna give me some on April Fool's day
(But no, no way) nah, (no, no-no, no-no, no-no way)

The preacher's daughter, she an illegitimate child
She know the Word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul
She married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now
See her in the market place loud and boisterous
With tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters
She a seductress in the form of a goddess
Never virtuous or modest, poison the part is
Breakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother
Man, that's how she molest you
That's why the preacher man prolly a mess too
Cause the fruit that she devourin' is evil
Never sin around righteous people

The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man

I met her on the bus stop with black eyes
That's why she said she don't fuck with black guys
I cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom
Her father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision
Brutal ass whoopins, always facin' these evictions
So she only fuck with thugs that'll wind up in the system
Them greasy bastards quick to squeeze a ratchet
Never knew the science of virtue, Ecclesiastes
Like, a time for peace, a time for war
A time to laugh though, she never felt God before
Eternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk
Between me and her, it don't concern you

Anytime somethin' new comes along...everybody wants a bite
Don't happen overnight

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust no body
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Looking in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
The rock crowd, make money, chill with the honey's
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin' with it, nevertheless
You got to go for the gusto but you don't know
About the blood, sweat and tears and losing some of your peers
And losing some of yourself to the years past gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act
Shit's deep, 48 tracks
Studio gangster mack signed the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
But never will 'til he crosses over
Still filling your head with fantasies
Come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rock superstar in the biz?
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
And some can't pay the way
Still trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The route you took started collapsing
No fans, no fame, no respect, no change, no women
And everybody shits on your name

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust no body
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
So you wanna be a rock superstar?

People see rockstars, younawhaI'msayin?
But you still...try'na...get out more like, like everybody else
It's a fun job, but it's still a job
Save your money man, save your money too
It's single don't last very long, younawhaI'msayin?
I mean...you're lucky in this game too
There's gon' be another cat comin' out
Lookin' like me, soundin' like me, next year I know this
They'll be a flipside, do whatchu you do
Somebody'll try to spin off like some series

You ever have big dreams of makin' big cream?
Big shot, heavy hitter on the mainstream
You wanna look shanty in the Bentley
Be a snob and never act friendly
You wanna have big fame, let me explain
What happends to these stars and their big brains
First they get played like all damn day
Long as you sell everything will be O.K
Then you get dissed by the media and fans
Things never stay the same way they began
I heard that some never give full to the fullest
That's while fools end up dining on the bullet
Think everything's fine in the big time
See me in my Lex' with the chrome raised high
So you wanna roll far and live large?
It ain't all that goes with bein' a rockstar

So you wanna be a rock superstar?

My own son don't know me
I'm chillin' in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm with my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or video didn't show me
No love, the phony, gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like Monie
And the press say that my own people disown me
And the best way back is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
They're too worried about them honies at the Paladium
Who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on
Go on, fall off, the hoes roll on
'Til the next rock superstar with no shame
Give him a year, he'll be right out the game
The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame, started gettin' ignored, I warned him
Assured him, this ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin' lethal
""Assassins, assassins""

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, 5 cars, you're in charge

I don't really mind the cold

I woke up on Champs-Élysées to the Djembe of Ghana
Where a fine lady from Belize said ""You got the spirit of Fela""
A young one dripping make-up put her hands out to holla
Well, I gave her what I got but couldn't handle her broken heart
The right words in the hands of dissidents with the fire
Will rip apart the marrow from the bone of the liars
And well, I'm afraid of saying too much and ending a martyr
Even more so I'm afraid to face God and say I was a coward, yeah

With all these things I wait for revelation
These things make me want to duck for cover
With all these things I wait for revolution
These things ask the biggest question to me
And it's are you what you want to be
So are you what you want to be?

The war machine will put out both its hands for a dollar
It's drinking at the table with the chrome hand guerrillas
The young ones dripping make-up lift her leg up to holla
Well, I told her what she's got should be protected in the arms of love
The right things in the hands of dissidents with the fire
Will rip apart the marrow from the bone of the liars
Well I'm afraid of saying too much and ending a martyr
But even more so I'm afraid to face God and say I was a coward, yeah

With all these things I wait for revelation

Pórtate bien que te vo'a pagar las tetas

Letra de ""Facetime""
Tu novio te manda un texto
Poniéndome pretexto
No té quiere ver conmigo
Será que 'e mí enemigo (llámalo por Facetime)

Dile que te llame por Facetime, pa' que no' vea matando
Matando, matando, matando, matando
Dile que te llame por Facetime, pa' que no' vea matando
Matando, matando, matando, matando

Dile que te llamé, que té tengo sorpresa
Ya tu sabé que lo que, me duele la cabeza
Pero no la de arriba, me duele la de abajo
Ella 'tá asfixia de mí, porque le hice un trabajo (¡wou!)
Cuándo 'tá sola, me tira al Whatsapp
Que tú ere' muy flojo, que tu no la sabé matar (slash)
Yo la pongo a que vire los ojos pa' 'trás
Ella no fuma, pero yo la pongo a que coja una nota de crack
El té da todo lo cualto y yo lo que hace falta
Cuándo tu 'tás con el, yo te hago falta
El tiene yeepeta y muchos bienes
Pero conmigo e' que te vienes

Dile que te llame por Facetime, pa' que no' vea matando
Matando, matando, matando, matando
Dile que te llame por Facetime, pa' que no' vea matando
Matando, matando, matando, matando

Él té compra cartera Gucci y Louis Vuitton
Te sacó de Haina y té metió pa' Bronx
Te compré un apartamento en la torre 'e Donald Trump
Pero tu cómo quiera de diste su botón
Yo lo tengo má' duro que la situación
Un atleta sexual, en la cama acción
Se la sacó a cada rato
En el Playboy me vio y me ofreció un contrató
E' que yo no tengo cualto
Pero en la cama, juego de cuatro cualto
No le hablé de cualto, que ella quiere martillar
Tu no ve' que ella me llama a mí, pa' lo' cualto tuyo ga'ta' (palomo)

Dile que te llame por Facetime, pa' que no' vea matando
Matando, matando, matando, matando
Dile que te llame por Facetime, pa' que no' vea matando

Llegaste con una esperanza
Mi espera tuvo un final
Hablabas cuando yo te amaba
Y te burlabas o creias que te hacia tanta falta

Me hiciste ver que habia algo mas

No puedo volar me has herido en vano

Despacio y me desangra
Tan fuerte que hoy acaba mi paciencia ante ti
Mis ganas de vivir y me rindo a este sufrir

Beware the bottled thoughts of angry young men
Secret compartments hide all of the skeletons
Little girl wants to make her home with him
In the middle of the shore, she wonders
""Don't know what you asked for""
""Don't know what you asked for""
All young lovers know why
Nightmares blind their mind's eye
Your rube is young and handsome
So new to your bedroom floor
You know damn well where you'll go
I've loved so many times and I've drowned them all
From their coral graves, they rise up when darkness falls
With their bones they'll scratch the window
I hear them call
""Don't know what you asked for""
""Don't know what you asked for""
""Don't know what you asked for""
All young lovers know why
Nightmares blind their mind's eye

Stay with me under these waves, tonight
Be free for once in your life, tonight

Pero el tiempo no sabe marchitar

Y esa fuerza volcánica de su mirar

Que hay detrás de esos hilos de plata
Y esa grasa abdominal
Que los aeróbicos no saben quitar

Póngale vida a los años que es mejor

Póngale vida a los años que es mejor

Al hacer el amor
Siente las mismas cosquillas
Que sintió hace mucho mas de veinte
Notelo as¡ de repente
Es usted amalgama perfecta
Entre experiencia y juventud

Usted no necesita enseñar
Su figura detrás de un escote
Su talento est en manejar
Con mas cuidado el arte de amar
Señora de las cuatro décadas
No insista en regresar a los 30
Con sus 40 y tantos encima
Deja huellas por donde camina
Que la hacen dueña de cualquier lugar

Que no hablo de otra cosa que no sea de usted
Que es lo que tengo que hacer señora
Para ver si se enamora
De este 10 años menor...

Todo empezó un lunes de setiembre
La magnitud de la ruptura tardo 24 horas en digerirse
Cuando se hizo martes, y fue de noche
Los fantasmas de la ausencia empezaron a adueñarse de todo
Mientras se desintegraban los sueños
Se multiplicaban los fantasmas
La risa, como cosa del pasado
El llanto, lluvia desbordada
Aprender a vivir en compañía
Fue negarse a vivir en soledad
El aire se hace denso
Los días se hacen largos
Y las noches son infiernos de insomnio y melancolía
Tantos martes, tantos setiembres
Y solo acá, una fecha cualquiera
Marco el principio, de un final en pausas
Ese día empezó, lo que terminaba

Cabe un siglo en este martes por la noche
Dueles más que el peor dolor que se inventó
El espejo lanza dardos de reproche
Hoy empieza lo que ya se terminó
La esperanza se tiró por la ventana
El insomnio se quedó a vivir aquí
El ayer lo dejó todo pa'mañana
Y el mañana, cuando esté, yo ya me fui

No consigo respirar
Hago apnea desde el día en que no estás
Caigo hasta el fondo del mar
Arañando la burbuja en que no estás
Imposible respirar
El oxígeno se fue de este lugar

Te regalo esta canción desesperada
Desabrida como lunes por la tarde
Colapsado caigo al fondo y en picada
Y no tengo ni el valor pa'ser cobarde

No consigo respirar
Hago apnea desde el día en que no estás
Caigo hasta el fondo del mar
Arañando la burbuja en que no estás
Imposible respirar
El oxígeno se fue de este lugar

Prisa de rendirse y claudicar
Descenso en espiral, profundidad
Amnesia de pelear por respirar
Deseo de rendirse en soledad
Oxígeno golpeando una pared
El pulso tropezando sin radar
Colapsa corazón a su merced
Morir será mejor que recordar

No consigo respirar
Hago apnea desde el día en que no estás
Caigo hasta el fondo del mar
Arañando la burbuja en que no estás
Imposible respirar
El oxígeno se fue de este lugar

El reloj de pared
Anunciando las 6:23
El pasado con sed
Y el presente es un atleta sin pies
Ya son las 6:43
Y el cadáver del minuto que paso
Me dice así se vive aquí te guste o no
Y la nostalgia pone casa en mi cabeza
Y dan las 6 con 50
Quien te dijo que yo
Era el sueño que soñaste una vez
Quien te dijo que tú
Voltearías mi futuro al revés
Ya son las 7:16
Y el cadáver del minuto que pasó
Me dice tu estrategia te arruinó
No queda más que ir aprendiendo a vivir solo
Si te quedan agallas
La casa no es otra cosa
Que un cementerio de historias
Enterradas en fosas
Que algunos llaman memorias
Minutos, Como sal en la herida
Se me pasa la vida
Gastando el reloj
Minutos, Son la morgue del tiempo
Cadáveres de momentos
Que no vuelven jamás
No hay reloj que de vuelta hacia atrás
Como duele gastar
El instante en el que tu ya no estas
Como cuesta luchar
Con las cosas que no vuelven mas
Ya son las 9:23
Y el cadáver del minuto que paso
Se burla de mis ganas de besar
La foto que dejaste puesta en el buró
Mi soledad es tu venganza
El ministerio del tiempo
Puso sede en mi almohada
Ahí te encuentro a momentos
Aunque no sirve de nada
Minutos, Como sal en la herida
Se me pasa la vida
Gastando el reloj
Minutos, Son la morgue del tiempo
Cadáveres de momentos
Que no vuelven jamás
No hay reloj que de vuelta hacia atrás
Minutos que se burlan de mi
Minutos como furia de mar
Minutos pasajeros de un tren que no va a ningún lugar
Minutos como lluvia de sal
Minutos como fuego en la piel
Minutos forasteros que vienen y se van sin decir
Minutos que me duelen sin ti
Minutos que no pagan pensión
Minutos que al morir formaran el batallón de ayer
Minutos que se roban la luz
Minutos que me oxidan la fe
Minutos inquilinos del tiempo mientras puedan durar
Minutos que disfrutan morir
Minutos que no tienen lugar
Minutos que se estrellan en mi....son kamikases de Dios

Sometimes you gotta put your pride to the side in this game that we call life
You know I'm tryna get back to my kids
You know I can’t win with these crackers
I'm a nigga, and they look at me like a nigga
Like let me go on lay down right quick, fuck it

No self worth bein' honest
But I converse with some bosses (I do)
I’m a real earner and I worked hard
Thanking God look what I accomplished (Allahu Akbar)
Inside support system awkward
Take time with trial, only options
Division nine, no PC in Chicago, fighting drama
My relationship gettin' rocky
No spousal trust, I was movin' unconscious
I was talking with Jay and  recruited a move that allotted me counsel
Back and forth without representation embarrassin' ran out of options
Told my attorney go get with the DA
He come with a deal and I'm coppin'
Aiming for 36 months but he came with a 30 so fuck it, I signed it
He think I'm stupid, well fuck what he think
I ain't fight with them crackers, I got out they way
Stateville, now I’m going up state with the gang members
They respectin’ my name
You one of the mean, you play with the kid
You gon have to kill 'em you one of the greats

No need to say it, I was sufferin’
My head hurtin' of concussion
Broke bed on me fuck it
I don't think they really love me
Trust issues, I'm accustomed
Writers block, no question nah
Already knowin’ you gon' lie to me, ain't no need to discuss it
Ain't no need to discuss it
We have a heated discussion
Internet beef, I don't entertain
I know how to come up from nothin'
I'm gettin' straight to the money(yeah)
I'm gettin' straight to the money(yeah)
Already knowin' you gon' lie to me, ain't no need to discuss it

I'm an energy person and I'm at ease
But the minute you hurt me you gotta leave
Got some niggas who love me, they outta reach
Got some children who comin' up, gotta teach
Got some family who mad cause they tryna leach
Got some big booty woman who I don't need
Master manipulation, been manipulated
But it really don't bother me
Gold trim platinum, matte white Benz
V12, yellow color baguettes
Red guts, panoramic, my roof
Any given moment I can hop in a jet
In the weight room gettin' rid of weight
Pat touchdown, doin' a set
Hit the space bar, click and refresh
Making salat when I need to reset (Allahu Akbar)
Turnin' the pot got me whippin' the vet
On the phone, communication with the joint
Still going in tryna prove a point
I don't socialize, I don't see the point
50 wrapped up, stuffed in a bump
Underneath the trunk
Order what you want
Laying in the trunk sipping red wine
I don't give a fuck
I do what I want

No need to say it, I was sufferin'
My head hurtin' of concussion
Broke bed on me fuck it
I don't think they really love me
Trust issues, I'm accustomed
Writers block, no question nah
Already knowin' you gon' lie to me, ain't no need to discuss it
Ain't no need to discuss it
We have a heated discussion
Internet beef, I don't entertain
I know how to come up from nothin'
I'm gettin' straight to the money
I'm gettin' straight to the money

Justamente ahora
Irrumpes en mi vida
Con tu cuerpo exacto y ojos de asesina
Tarde como siempre
Nos llega la fortuna
Tu ibas con el
Yo iba con ella
Jugando a ser felices por desesperados
Por no aguardar los sueños
Por miedo a quedar solos
Pero llegamos tarde
Te vi
Me viste
Nos reconocimos enseguida pero tarde
Maldita sea la hora
Que encontré lo que soñé
Tarde..
Tanto soñarte y extrañarte sin tenerte
Tanto inventarte
Tanto buscarte por las calles como un loco
Sin encontrarte
Ahí va uno de tonto
Por desesperado
Confundiendo amor con compañía
Y ese miedo idiota de verte viejo y sin pareja
Que hace escoger con la cabeza lo que es del corazón
Y no tengo nada contra ellos
La rabia es contra el tiempo por ponerte junto a mi, tarde...
Ganas de huir
De no verte ni la sombra
De pensar que esto fue un sueño o una pesadilla
Que nunca apareciste
Que nunca has existido
Ganas de tocarte
Ganas de besarte
De coincidir contigo
Y amarrarte en un abrazo
De mirarte a los ojos
Y decirte bienvenida
Pero llegamos tarde
Te vi
Me viste
Nos reconocimos enseguida pero tarde
Quizás en otras vidas
Quizás en otras muertes...
Que ganas de tocarte
Que ganas de rozarte
De coincidir contigo
Y golpearte con un beso
De fugarnos para siempre
Sin daños a terceros

No vengas con sermones ni alabanzas
Ni vuelvas a decir lo que ya sé
Trae tus aretes de mudanza
Y el vestido aquel que siempre te quité
Te invito a que me invites esta noche
Al pecado que jamás yo te invité
Te invito a que te abstengas de reproches
Si todos mis defectos ya los sé
Hay amores como el tuyo
Que duelen cuando están o si se van
Hay amores sin orgullo
Que viven de perder la dignidad

La muerte me enseñó que hay que vivir
No arregles lo que no se descompuso
Que nadie aquí está listo pa' cambiar
Amores que se gastan con el uso
Merecen libertad y descansar
No pidas que te diga lo que sabes
Ni quieras saber lo que no sé
De todo lo demás tienes las llaves
Y si hace falta algo lo olvidé

Duele verte con un tipo al que le faltan las ideas
Y le sobran argumentos
Duele verte anestesiada porque así se dio la cosa
Porque así quiso tu suerte
Mientras yo caliento el banco de suplentes
Con la camiseta puesta para incluirme en tu futuro
Mientras yo te doy de día
Lo que él no cumple en las noches
Aquí está tu clandestino
Pa' jugar al escondite como amante guerrillero
Pa'cubrirte tus carencias de ternura y desenfreno
Aunque yo no esté en la foto de la sala de tus padres
Ni en el bautizo del sobrino
Y es que tú ahora tienes dos y a mí me dividen una...
Cierra puertas y ventanas
Que el mismísimo cielo pondrá una sucursal
En el séptimo piso a las once cincuenta
Mientras duren los besos y permita el reloj
Cierra puertas y ventanas que en noventa minutos
Habrá que condensar las caricias que caben en los huecos
Que dejan los encuentros furtivos y la soledad
Y es que tú ahora tienes dos y a mí me dividen una...
Puede ser que tu conciencia te castigue por las noches
Y te aliente en las mañanas
Puede ser que un día de tantos nos quedemos sin futuro
Y tú sigas con tu teatro
Mientras tanto dame un beso atrincherado
De ésos que por ser culpables
Son como agua en el desierto
Tómame como al tequila de un golpe y sin pensarlo
Que si alguien sale ganando eres tú querida amiga
Aunque pienses lo contrario
Y es que tú ahora tienes dos y a mí me dividen una
Cierra puertas y ventanas
Que el mismísimo cielo pondrá una sucursal

Ella vende besos en un burdel
Mientras el se gradua en U.C.L.A
Ella es medio Marxista, él es Republicano
Ella quiere ser artista, él odia a los Cubanos

Y ella en su vieja Habana de la Soledad
El ha comido hamburguesas
Ella moros con crisitanos
El, el champagne con sus fresas
Ella un mojito Cubano
Ella se fue de gira a Yucatán
Y el de vacaciones al mismo lugar
Mulata hasta los pies, el rubio como el sol
Ella no habla Inglés y el menos Español
El fue a tomar un trago sin sospechar
Que iba a encontrar el amor en aquél lugar
Lo que las ideologías dividen al hombre
El amor con sus hilos los une en su nombre
Ella mueve su cintura al ritmo de un tan tan
Y él se va divorciando del Tio Sam
El se refugia en su piel... la quiere para él
Y ella se va olvidando de Fidel
Que sabian Lenin y Lincoln del amor?
Que saben Fidel y Clinton del amor?
Ella se sienta en su mesa, el tiembla de la emoción
Ella se llama Teresa y el se llama John
Ella dice hola chico, el contesta hello
A ella no le para el pico, el dice speak slow
El se guardo su bandera, ella olvidó los conflictos
El encontro la manera de que el amor salga invicto
La tomó de la mano y se la llevó
El Yanqui de la Cubana se enamoró

El amor con sus hilos los une en su nombre

Y el se va divorciando del Tio Sam
El se refugia en su piel... la quiere para el
Y ella se va olvidando de Fidel

Otra luna nueva y yo te quiero
Mucho más que tres lunas atrás
Te quiero mucho más de lo que puedo
Te quiero aunque decirlo esté de más
Yo te quiero
El mundo esta al reves y yo te quiero
Quererte me hace ser alguien mejor
Te quiero a veces más de lo que quiero
Te quiero aunque a veces cause dolor
Yo te quiero
No voy a rebuscar en la academia
Palabras para ver quien me las premia
Si este mundo cabe en dos palabras
Te quiero
Te quiero mientras dure que te quiera
Te quiero porque es la mejor manera
De burlarme de tus enemigos
Te quiero porque así es como te quiero
Te quiero y sabes bien que me refiero
A no quererte más porque no puedo
Pensé que era importante
Que supieras que te quiero y nada más
Ya fui un tipo duro como acero
De esos que se guardan la emoción
""Yo primero muerto que un te quiero""
Decía antes de hacerte esta canción
Te quiero
Te quiero solo porque a ti te quiero
Que sería de mi si no es así
Como dijo Pablo a sangre y fuego
Como digo yo te quiero así

All you bastards at the I.R.S

For the shots of Jack and the caps of meth
Half pints of love and a fifth of stress
All the hookers that are tricking out in Hollywood
And for my hoods of the world misunderstood
I said it's all good and it's all in fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone


For the time bombs ticking and the heads they hang
All the gangs gettin' money and the heads they bang - bang
Wild mustangs, the porno flicks
All my homies in the county in cell block six
The grits when there ain't enough eggs to cook
And to D.B. Cooper and the money he took
You can look for answers but that ain't fun

Se peina y se guilla
Se viste y se maquilla

O te siento en mi silla
Hoy tú vas a ser mía

Cuida'o si te tira
Y si tu novio se activa

Ella es mi gata en celo
Quiere buscar rebuleo del bueno
Quiere fingir que no le gusta el blin-blineo
Y cuando canto hasta abajo con mi perreo
Por ahí anda su novio en un fantasmeo
Verdad, que esta noche va haber un tiroteo
Dile que yo ando con mis gatos en el patrulleo
(Y al que se lamba, jura'o me lo llevo!)

So we did it again
Knowing we should quit it, but we simply won't admit it again
Oh it feels good, it's so good, but I won't do it again
It's so dramatic again
After we go at it, we get mad then we go at it again
Oh I love it, then I hate it, she's my favorite again
I'm wasting time
I can't help it she's so fine
Oh I like her style
And I love the way she talks and I smile
As much as we may try
Can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime, I guess we say bye-bye
(And again and again and again)
Oh, and then, we do it again
We do it again and we do it again
Oh, and then, we do it again
We want it again, and we want it again
So we fake it again
I think we're gonna blow it, and we know it
But she's naked again
We get wasted, then I taste it, then I waste it again
I can't invite her again
Cause she'll go from a lover to a fighter
And I'll fight her again
So it's over, but I told her to come over again
I'm wasting time
But she's always on my mind
I can't let her go
Oh, she's not the best, but she's all that I know
As much as we may try
Can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime I guess we say bye-bye
(And again and again and again)
Oh, and then, we do it again
We do it again and we do it again
Oh, and then, we do it again
We want it again, and we want it again
So I've got a new friend
I wish I could forget you
But I miss you, wanna kiss you again
She's like you, but she's not you, gotta find you again
So we remember again
The middle of December and I took you out to dinner again
Oh I love her, it's not over, just another again
(And again and again and again)
Oh, it's another again-
I love her, it's another again...

Cuando tu estas conmigo
Es cuando yo digo
Que valió la pena
Todo,todo lo que yo he sufrido

No se si es un sueño aún
O es una realidad
Pero cuando estoy contigo es cuando digo:
Que este amor que siento
Es porque tu lo has merecido
Con decirte amor que otra vez he amanecido
Llorando de felicidad;
A tu lado yo siento que estoy viviendo
Nada es como ayer

Abrázame que el tiemo pasa y el nunca perdona
Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona
Abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo
Abrázame que el tiempo es oro si tu estas conmigo
Abrázame fuerte, muy fuerte, más fuerte que nunca
Siempre abrázame

Hoy que tu estas conmigo
Yo no se si esta pasando el tiempo o tu lo has detenido
Así quiero estar por siempre
Aprovecho que estas tu conmigo
Te doy gracias por cada momento de mi vivir
Tu cuando mires para el cielo
Por cada estrella que aparezca amor es un ""te quiero""

Abrázame que el tiempo hiere y el cielo es testigo
Que el tiempo es cruel y a nadie quiere por eso te digo:
Abrázame muy fuerte amor, mantenme así a tu lado
Yo quiero agradecerte amor todo lo que me has dado
Quiero corresponderte de una forma u otra a diario;
Amor yo nunca del dolor he sido partidario
Pero a mi me toco sufrir cuando confié y creí
En alguien que juró que daba su vida por mi

Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y ese no se detiene
Abrázame muy fuerte amor que el tiempo en contra viene
Abrázame que dios perdona pero el tiempo a ninguno
Abrázame que no le importa saber quien es uno
Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y el nunca perdona
Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona
Abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo
Abrázame muy fuerte amor

Todos quieren reinar y ninguno busca de Dios
Donde, donde estan los que se creen que están arriba..
Por eso y Donde
Donde están que no los veo
Donde
Ahora los veo corriendo
Porque
Oyeron mi voz denuevo
Se asustan
Porque todos me tienen miedo
Alerta! Se oyeron disparos
Siento decirles varones que han fallado
El que por la unción ustedes no han derrotado
Y Ahora retumba su voz pa' dejarle los pelos parados
El causante de que sea un Boricua sin miedo
Razón por la cual cantantes y locutores se unieron
Para tratar de quebrantarme mi sueño
Pero de arriba decíá el Dios del cielo...
Dale Bambino!
Enseñales, demuestrales que mientras
Esté firme caeran todos rendidos
Y aunque aquellos que fueron tus hermanos
Se conviertan en tus enemigos
No podrán, no podrán contigo

Y Se asustan
Porque todos me tienen miedo
Y hagan lo que quieran, digan lo que digan
Ninguno de ustedes me pasará por encima
Y aunque quisieran verme en una tumba fría
Voy a seguir cantando, siendo su pesadilla
El que no los barre pues no comparte su ignorancia
Se diferencia de ustedes por su elegancia
El que retumba con voz de trueno
Y se le ve sube sin que aunque ustedes oren pa que caiga al suelo

Canto de tristeza
Por que lo nuestro terminó
Te vas
Ya nunca volverás
Te olvidarás de mí
Y hoy muy triste
Me quedo solo,sin tí
Que seas muy felíz
Deseo mi amor
Que nunca llores
Que nunca sufras así

Con esta mi canción
He venido a pedirte perdón
Que nunca llores
Que nunca sufras así
Que encuentres cariño
Y todo el amor que
Yo jamás te pude dar;
Tu que eres tan buena
Mereces ternura y cariño;
Yo tuve la culpa de todo
No supe tu amor aquilatar
Merezco tu olvido y tu ausencia
Ya nunca tendré más tu amor
Adiós 
Mi amor

Para tí

He venido a pedirte que perdones
Por favor,por amor

Sé que núnca tú querras volver
Y yo quiero por último decirte amor que

Víctimas de la gravedad

No dudaría en promover tu cintura

Que el de tu piel ajustada a tu figura

Tu reputación son las primeras
Seis letras de esa palabra
Llevarte a la cama era más fácil que respirar
Tu teléfono es de total dominio popular
Y tu colchón tiene más huellas que una playa en pleno verano
Has hecho el amor mas veces que mi abuela
Y aún no acabas ni la escuela
Y aún sabiendo que no eres el mejor partido
Dime quien puede contra Cupido
Y es que si yo no he sido un monje
Por qué voy a exigirte que seas santa
Si el pasado te enseñó a besar así
Bendito sea el que estuvo antes de mi
No es dama la que se abstiene
Dama es la que se detiene
Cuando encuentra lo que tu encontraste aquí
Si el pasado te enseñó a tocarme así
Benditos los que estuvieron antes de mi
Si otros han sido tu escuela
Yo seré tu graduación
Cuando incluyas en la cama al corazón
Dicen por ahi que tu terrible fama de ligera
Ha venido a pintarme un par de cuernos en la mollera
Que tengo que sacarte del barrio y del país
Si es que quiero darle a esta historia un final feliz
Si supieran la ternura inmensa que hay en ti
Y todo lo que haces por mi
Sabrían que el camino andado antes de aquí
Te ha preparado para mi
Ven y abrazame sin miedos
Y dame un beso a la salud de los chismosos
Si el pasado te enseñó a besar así
Bendito sea el que estuvo antes de mi
No es dama la que se abstiene
Dama es la que se detiene
Cuando encuentra lo que tu encontraste aquí
Si el pasado te enseñó a tocarme así
Benditos los que estuvieron antes de mi
Si otros han sido tu escuela
Yo seré tu graduación
Cuando incluyas en la cama al corazón
Si otros han sido tu escuela
Yo seré tu graduación
Cuando incluyas en la cama al corazón

Amarte a ti no es lo mejor, lo tengo claro
Habiendo tantas cosas por hacer, menos traumáticas
Como hallarle figuras a las nubes
O como ir al cine o no hacer nada
Amarte a ti no es lo mejor, pero me gusta
Quizás estoy jugando como siempre al masoquista
En ves de distraerme con el fútbol
O con el Internet como hacen todos
Amarte a ti no es lo mejor, pero es perfecto
Para encontrarle algún sentido a esta rutina
De ser por siempre solo un ciudadano
Solo uno mas
Amarte a ti me hace sufrir, que buena suerte
Para acordarme de que existo y de que siento
Para tener en que pensar todas las noches
Para vivir
Amarte a ti es un veneno que da vida
Es una antorcha que se enciende si se apaga
Es lo sublime junto con lo idiota
Es lo que siento y a quién le importa
Amarte a ti es la verdad más mentirosa
Es lo mejor de lo peor que me ha pasado
Es la ruleta rusa por un beso
Es lo de siempre improvisado
Amarte a ti es un error dice un amigo
Que cree que ser feliz es estar libre
Y se pierde del matiz que da lo incierto
Amarte a ti
Es la embajada de un instante en mi cerebro
Es también haberte odiado un par de veces
Amarte a ti es un absurdo y lo sabemos
Y así será... Mientras nos dure

Con poca azucar
Quiza un croissant
No hibi por la tertulia
O el flirteo

Quiza echarle un vistazo
A las malas nuevas en los diarios
O sacudirme esa peresa cronica
De mis amaneceres

Que solo fui
Por un cafe

Y cambiaste mi vida, mi ritmo, mi espacio
Mi tiempo, mi historia, mis sueños y todo

Que esa mañana en el cafe
Yo ira a coincidir con el milagro
De pisar el mismo espacio
A la misma hora que te vi
Y como si esto fuera poco
Que tus ojos se fijaran justamente en mi

Cowboy
Cowboy

Well I'm packin' up my game and I'mma head out west
Where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts
Find a nest in the Hills, chill like Flynt
Buy an old drop-top find a spot to pimp
And I'mma Kid Rock it up and down ya' block
With a bottle of scotch and watch lots a crotch
Buy a yacht with a flag sayin' ""Chillin' the Most""
Then rock that bitch up and down the coast
Give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars
Get thrown in the mix and get tossed outta bars
Sip the Tiajuana, I want to roam
Find Motown, tell them fools to come back home
Start an escort service for all the right reasons
And set up shop at the top of Four Seasons
Kid Rock and I'm the real McCoy
And I'm headed out west sucker because I want to be a

Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
West Coast chillin' with the Boone's wine
I want to be a Cowboy, baby!
Ride at night cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away

I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin when my train rolls in
It goes (whistling), like dust in the wind
Stoned pimp, stoned freak, stoned out of my mind
I once was lost but now I'm just blind
Palm trees and weeds, scabbed knees and rice
Get a map to the stars, find Heidi Fleiss
And if the price is right then I'm gonna make my bid boy
And let Cali-for-ni-a know why they call me


Yeah!
Kid Rock you can call me Tex
Rollin' Sunset woman with a bottle of Beck's
Seen a slimmy in a 'Vette, rolled down my glass
And said ""Yeah this dick fits right in your ass""
No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor
Call me hoss, I'm the boss with the sauce and the whores
No remorse for the sheriff, in his eye I ain't right
I'ma paint his town red then paint his wife white
Cause chaos rock like Amedeus
Find West Coast pussy for my Detroit playas
Mack like mayors ball like Lakers
They told us to leave but bet they can't make us
Why they wanna pick on me
Lock me up and snort away my key
I ain't no G, I'm just a regular failure
I ain't straight outta Compton, I'm straight out the trailer
Cuss like a sailor, drink like a mick
My only words of wisdom are just suck my dick
I'm flickin' my Bic up and down that coast and
Keep on truckin' till I fall in the ocean

You can say what you want about me
Try to do what you want to me
But you cannot stop me

I've been knocked down, it's a crazy town
Even got punched in the face in L.A
Ain't nothing in the world
That you keep me from doing what I wanna do
'Cause I'm too proud, I'm too strong
Live by the code that you gotta move on
Feeling sorry for yourself ain't got nobody nowhere so I...

But I won't live in fear

But first they want to build you up
Then they tear you down

Is when I search for the light, Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle and fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear.. Insomnia..
I can't get no sleep
I can't get no sleep
I used to worry, Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
No electricity, Something's all over me
Greasy insomnia, Please release me and let me dream of
Makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearin' off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, No peace, I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, Open my eyes, Rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, Kept takin' sleepers..
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, The night, I write by candle-light I find insight
From the mental movement
So when it's black, This insomniac takes an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. I gets no sleep..

Cuando tu estas conmigo
Es cuando yo digo
Que valió la pena
Todo,todo lo que yo he sufrido

No se si es un sueño aún
O es una realidad
Pero cuando estoy contigo es cuando digo:
Que este amor que siento
Es porque tu lo has merecido
Con decirte amor que otra vez he amanecido
Llorando de felicidad;
A tu lado yo siento que estoy viviendo
Nada es como ayer

Abrázame que el tiemo pasa y el nunca perdona
Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona
Abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo
Abrázame que el tiempo es oro si tu estas conmigo
Abrázame fuerte, muy fuerte, más fuerte que nunca
Siempre abrázame

Hoy que tu estas conmigo
Yo no se si esta pasando el tiempo o tu lo has detenido
Así quiero estar por siempre
Aprovecho que estas tu conmigo
Te doy gracias por cada momento de mi vivir
Tu cuando mires para el cielo
Por cada estrella que aparezca amor es un ""te quiero""

Abrázame que el tiempo hiere y el cielo es testigo
Que el tiempo es cruel y a nadie quiere por eso te digo:
Abrázame muy fuerte amor, mantenme así a tu lado
Yo quiero agradecerte amor todo lo que me has dado
Quiero corresponderte de una forma u otra a diario;
Amor yo nunca del dolor he sido partidario
Pero a mi me toco sufrir cuando confié y creí
En alguien que juró que daba su vida por mi

Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y ese no se detiene
Abrázame muy fuerte amor que el tiempo en contra viene
Abrázame que dios perdona pero el tiempo a ninguno
Abrázame que no le importa saber quien es uno
Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y el nunca perdona
Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona

You'll be given love
You'll be taken care of

You have poured yours

Que triste es saber que todo termino
Que triste es decirle a un amor adiós
Si tu me comprendierás, no te iría de mi
Lo que yo más quería es que fueras feliz
Y mañana, mañana
Ya será un día muy triste
Porque tu te irás y no volerás
Ya jamás a mi lado
Y mañana, mañana
Ya será un día muy triste
Porque el sueño de amor que vivíamos
Tu y yo... ahora lo haz despertado
Ya no quiero pedirte que te quedes mas
Ni quiero preguntarte para donde vas
Yo sé que tu haz venido a decirme adiós
Pues que tengas buenas suerte
Y hasta nunca amor

I can't unpack, I can't unlose
I can't unfake you've caused no pain
What are we going to do, me and you
I guess it's just different points of view
But I can't gain perspective
When you appear so unaffected

Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange
Does estranged feel strange? Estranged feels strange
When I never was a fighter and I don't want to blame
It's not the same as an argument
Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange

Now I can't relate, I can't feel safe
I can't retain, I can't stay the same
I can't even say your name, I count the days
I cannot stand this bitter taste
So, what's the problem
Between us two?
Cause I can't find perspective
When I still feel so connected to you

Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange
I wish we had a fight, or reasons to hate
That always ends with an argument

I know you think that
I shouldn't still love you
Or tell you that
But if I didn't say it
Well, I'd still have felt it
Where's the sense in that?
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too
Much mess and destruction
To come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you
Can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of ""it's over""
Then I'm sure that that makes sense

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was there
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on

In the suburbs, I, I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving
You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting in a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore
But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again

The kids want to be so hard
But in my dreams, we're still screaming
And running through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothing at all
Meant nothing at all, it meant nothing

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling and into the night

So can you understand
Why I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I want to hold her hand
And show her some beauty before this damage is done
But if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
Then send me a son
Under the overpass
In the parking lot we're still waiting, it's already passed
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
'Cause it's already passed
It's already, already passed

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again
I'm moving past the feeling
I'm moving past the feeling

We're still screaming
We're still screaming

Swallow worries one by one

Gave hope and a brand new day

We wore his love like a hand in a glove

Plant the path you want to roam
Live where your heart can be given
And your life starts to unfold

I know you can, I wish you would
So trip inside this house as you pass by

In the water that you tread

In the stream that clears your head

Come disciples to thee unending
Subtleties of rhythm power
So trip inside this house as you pass by
Trip inside this house as you pass by

Trip, trip, trip inside
Trip, trip, trip inside

Sweep the shadows from your eyes
Sweep the realm of dark aside
So trip inside this house as you pass by
Trip inside this house as you pass by

Trip, trip, trip inside
Trip, trip, trip inside
Trip, trip, trip inside
Trip, trip, trip inside

Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
""We'll meet on edges, soon,"" said I
Proud 'neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
""Rip down all hate,"" I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
Girls' faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, though, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
""Equality,"" I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My pathway led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, ""Who is that man?""
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you'll say
When you get home
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
You raise up your head
And you ask, ""Is this where it is?""
And somebody points to you and says
""It's his""
And you say, ""What's mine?""
And somebody else says, ""Where what is?""
And you say, ""Oh my God
Am I here all alone?""
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, ""How does it feel
To be such a freak?""
And you say, ""Impossible""
As he hands you a bone
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations
You've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, ""Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan""
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word ""NOW""
And you say, ""For what reason?""
And he says, ""How?""
And you say, ""What does this mean?""
And he screams back, ""You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home""
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Boy!

Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me you're out of your mind

My baby is a ten
We dressing to the nine
He pick me up, we eight
Make me feel so lucky, seven
He kiss me in his six
We be making love in five
Still the one I do this four
I'm trying to make us three
From that two
He still the one

There's up's and downs in this love
Got a lot to learn in this love
Through the good and the bad, still got love
Dedicated to the one I love, hey
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sing
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain
I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line

Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it

All up in that black with his chick right beside him

Yup, I put it on him, it ain't nothing that I can't do
Yup, I buy my own, if he deserve it, buy his shit too
All up in the store, shorty, tricking if I want to
All up in the store, shorty, fly as we want to
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Damn, I think I love that boy, do anything for that boy (Boy)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now I'll never be the same, you and me until the end

All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it

Me and my boo in the coupe lip locking
All up in the back because the chicks keep flocking
All that gossip in ten years, stop it
London speed it up, Houston rock it

Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling

Ni podemos escribir un verso

No se si después de amanecer vamos a sentir la misma sed
Para que pensar y suponer, no preguntes cosas que no se
Yo no se

Para que jurar y prometer algo que no esta en nuestro poder

Tu bien sabes que no fue mi culpa
Tu te fuiste y sin decirme nada
Y apesar que llore como nunca
Ya no seguias de mi enamorada
Luego te fuiste y que regresabas
No me dijiste y sin mas nada
¿por que? no se
Pero fue asi
Asi fue
Te brinde la mejor de las suertes
Yo me propuse no hablarte, no verte
Y hoy que has vuelto
Ya de eso no hay nada
Ya no debo, no puedo quererte
Ya no te amo!, me he enamorado
De un ser divino, de un buen amor

Y a perdonar

Vengo bailando mi cuerpo
Para que bailes mi son

Y las estrellas te entrego
Para decir lo que siento

Y se refleja en mi alma
Será que como ese espejo nada se acaba

Si soltamos la amarra
Y nos dejamos al viento
No dejaré que lo incierto se vuelva eterno

Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger

I could have told you
She'd hurt you
She'd you love you a while
Then desert you
If only you asked
I could have told you so

I could have saved you
Some crying
Yes, I could have told you she's lying
But you were in love
And didn't want to know

I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises she'll never keep
And soon, it's over and done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with

Para amarte necesito una razón
Y es difícil creer que no exista
Una más que este amor
Sobra tanto
Dentro de este corazón
Y a pesar de que dicen
Que los años son sabios
Todavía se siente el dolor

Porque todo el tiempo
Que pase junto a ti
Dejó tejido su hilo dentro de mí

Y aprendí a quitarle al tiempo los segundos
Tú mi hiciste ver el cielo aún más profundo
Junto a ti creo que aumente más de 3 kilos
Con tus tantos dulces besos repartidos
Desarollaste mi sentido del olfato
Y fue por ti que aprendí a querer los gatos
Despegaste del cemento mis zapatos
Para escapar los dos volando un rato

Pero olvidaste una final
Instrucción porque aún
No se como vivir sin tu amor

Y descubrí lo que significa una rosa
Me enseñaste a decir mentiras piadosas
Para poder verte a horas no adecuadas
Y a reemplazar palabras por miradas
Y fue por ti que escribí más de 100 canciones
Y hasta perdoné tus equivocaciones
Y conocí más de mil formas de besar
Y fue por ti que descubrí lo que es amar
Lo que es amar

I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well, you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know, or seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

There's nothing where he used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on

Nothing's fine, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins

And now I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things

That I can touch, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see

Sé que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar
Que estas cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar girando siempre en un lugar
Sé que las ventanas se pueden abrir
Cambiar el aire depende de ti
Te ayudara vale la pena una vez más
Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro con el corazón
Es mejor perderse que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
Aunque ya ves que no es tan fácil empezar
Sé que lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá
Y así será la vida cambia y cambiará
Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más
Vale más poder brillar
Que solo buscar ver el sol

Gonna be a struggle
But ya know what

But I'm from London
Call me the Big Ben
I grew up in west
Specifically West Kendall
Now let me slow it down
A little bit so you can feel me
Cause where I'm from there
Wasn't xxxx to do
No not really
Who'da thought
That it would happen
This London chick start rappin
Now American boys are chattin
All about me with my wicked accent
And yes I stays on my grind
You go get yours I'll get mine
Don't worry bout it

It was kinda crazy
Still
No kids thus far myself
I'm scared of the pain
I might not do well as a mom
Still the work gets done
Yes I worry bout bills
But a change gonna come
I wanna play rapper
Rock the bells
But I only gotta stack
For the little estelza
You don't wanna know
Bout them days that go
I got pain overload
You don't wanna know
About the things I know
I just can't take no more
Most of the time
Though I gotta stay on
I gotta stay real
I gotta stay strong
You know I'm heavy
Cause I roll with gem
So I'm gonna be fresh
When the lights come on
Come on

Eri tu
Tra tutta quella gente
Eri tu
Con quell'aria importante
Eri tu
Che scioglievi il mio cielo di aquiloni
E trasformava in poesia
La città di muri
Eri tu
Quella notte che ci siamo persi
Tra mille fasi, contrattempi e controtempi
Mi riconosceresti mai
Negli occhi che ora hai?
E anche oggi rimando a domani
Per non pensarti più

Ma non ci credere a chi dice
Che questo tempo ci ha fatto perdere
Tu non gli credere

Lascio un passato di spettri
E cerco nuovi confini
Ma in questa notte d’estate
Un po' di freddo ci vuole
Lascio le mie paure
Ad un soffio di vento
Per coprirti le spalle
Solo col mio silenzio
E non distinguo più
Orizzonti, universi o destinazione
Ma sei ancora tu
La soluzione

Eri tu
Quella notte che ci siamo chiesti
Se doveva finire
Dove finiscono tutti i momenti
Che tanto già lo sai
Che li conserverai
Anche oggi rimando a domani
Il non pensarti più

Ma non ci credere a chi dice
Che questo fuoco diventa cenere
Tu non gli credere

Lascio un passato di spettri
E cerco nuovi confini

Un po' di freddo ci vuole
Lascio le mie paure
Ad un soffio di vento
Per coprirti le spalle

E non distinguo più
Orizzonti, universi o destinazione
Ma sei ancora tu
La soluzione

Con gli occhi rossi di chi ha corso troppo
O forse pianto non me lo ricordo
Ma il tuo ricordo che mi tengo stretto
È il mio domani

Lascio un passato di spettri
Col futuro davanti
Ma in questa notte d’estate
La vita è come ci vuole
Lascio le mie paure
Zulle spalle del tempo
Per riscrivere al buio
Il nostro cielo diverso
E non distinguo più
Orizzonti, universi o destinazione
Ma sei ancora tu

Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you about it

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (awuu)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys
I just want to enjoy
By having a very good time
And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (awuu)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she-wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (awuu)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

See, first of all
I know these so-called players wouldn't tell you this
But I'ma be real and say what's on my heart
Let's take this chance and make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start, yeah
When you think about, all the years we put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this far?
Then I think about, where would I be if we were to just fall apart
And I can't stand the thought of losing you

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't get no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while, girl, I must confess
Girl let's just get married I just want to get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger (so) we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl and I must confess
Let's get married

Said I done it all, but frankly girl I'm tired of this emptiness
I wanna come home to you and only you
'Cause making love to just anyone ain't happenin'
I just gotta be with you
Do you think about, us finishing something we started so long ago
I wanna give you my all
Do you think about, maybe us having some babies?
Come on, won't you be my lady
Forever, girl

I'm ready to, commit to you
And I just can't wait for that night
'Cause I need you here with me
And let's start a family

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't get no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while, girl, I must confess

I've just had the craziest week
Like a party bag of lies, booze, and then deceit
And I don't know why I want to voice this out loud

And we're not the same and I will wear that on my sleeve

Icky thump
Who'da thunk?
Sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico
Ahh well
What a chump
Well my head got a bump
When I hit it on the radio
Redhead señorita
Looking dead
Came and said
Need a bed
In Español
I said
Gimme a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar
And I don't need a microphone

Icky Thump
With a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat
And I was freaking
I was ready to go!
And I swear
Besides the hair
She had one white eye
One blank stare
Looking up
Lying there
On the stand
Near her hand
Was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane
Dry ice and something strange
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

White Americans, what
Nothing better to do
Why don't you kick yourself out
You're an immigrant too
Who's using who
What should we do?
Well, you can't be a pimp
And a prostitute too
Icky thump
Handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind
Looked around
And there was nobody else
Left alone
I hit myself with a stone
Went home and learned how
To clean up after myself

In my defence all my intentions were good
And heaven holds a place somewhere for the misunderstood
You know I'd give you blood if it'd be enough
Devils on my doorstep since the day I was born
It's hard to find a sunset in the eye of a storm
But I'm a dreamer by design and I know in time we'll put this behind

For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, ""I made my own mistakes""
For what it's worth I know it's just a word and words betray
Sometimes we lose our way
For what it's worth

Behind the lens is a poison picture you paint
And lets not pretend you were ever searching for saints
'Cause I've been crucified for just being alive
Somewhere in the crossfire of this whispering war
Seems that I've forgot just what I was fighting for
But underneath my skin there's a fire within
Still burning

For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, ""I made my own mistakes""
For what it's worth I know it's just a word and words betray
Sometimes we lose our way
For what it's worth

The first bird to fly gets all the arrows
Let's leave the past behind with all our sorrows
I'll build a bridge between us and I'll swallow my pride

For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, ""I made my own mistakes""

I was born in a thunderstorm
I grew up overnight
I played alone
I played on my own
I survived
Hey
I wanted everything I never had
Like the love that comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
But I survived

I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing

Way in the back of my mind
I saw my life in a stranger's face

That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted; I went in and got it
Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
And all in spite of you

And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing

Me enamoré
De la persona ideal
Pero a la vez
Se tuvo que ir...
Ay es que el dolor que desgarró
Toda mi alma y corazón
Para vivir de los recuerdos de este amor
Cuando agarrados de la mano
En el parque nos besamos
Y las lágrimas caían
En los pétalos de rosa
Y tristemente me dijiste así:
Me tengo que ir
Y no es por mi contigo está mi corazón
Todo el amor de mis entrañas
De mi pecho y de mi alma
Algún día volveré a estar aquí
Me tengo que ir
Así es la vida y tiene desilusión
Se tiene amor y hay esperanza
Cuando se quiere con el alma
Al prójimo que Dios te puso ahí
Llega otro amor
De mi persona ideal
Pero también
Se tuvo que ir...
Ay es que el dolor que había en su vientre
Un niño estaba presente
Y en sus cartas me decía
Que alguien perdería la vida
Y tristemente me escribió así:
Me tengo que ir
Y no es por mi contigo está mi corazón

De mi cuerpo y de mi alma
Todo el fruto de este amor que queda ahí

Ella tiene la magia de un instante de amor
Y su mirada un toque de misterio
Cuando ella llega siempre, suelo perder el control
No vuelvo a ser el mismo si la beso
La conciencia me dice que no la debo querer
Y el corazón me grita que si debo
La conciencia me frena, cuando la voy a querer y
El corazón me empuja hasta el infierno
Al abismo dulce y tierno de sus besos
CORO:
Cuando se aferra un querer al corazón
Y la conciencia no tiene la razón
No valen los consejos
Cuando se prueba del fruto del querer
Cuando se aprende a sentir mas de una vez
No queda más remedio que darle cielo y alas al amor
Y hacer de lo difícil lo más bello
La conciencia me dice que la debo olvidar
Y el corazón me grita que no puedo
La conciencia no sabe que no se puede hacer mas
Cuando te vuelves preso de unos besos, de un te quiero, del deseo, del corazón
CORO:
Me dice el corazón
Que la quiera y me entregue sin condición
Pero me grita la conciencia
Que lo piense bien que no cometa esa imprudencia
Me dice el corazón
Olvidar es mejor la pasada experiencia
Pero me grita la conciencia
Peligro cuidado utiliza la razón
Me dice el corazón
No pierdas por nada esta ocasión
Pero me grita la conciencia
Equivocarte de nuevo no puede ser coincidencia
Me dice el corazón
Dale paso al amor que esta tocando tu puerta
Pero me grita la conciencia
Te va hacer llorar te va hacer sufrir traerá decepción
Me dice el corazón
Ríndete el amor te venció
Pero me grita la conciencia
Parece pero no es eso pasa con frecuencia
Me dice el corazón
Que debo quererla

Que no es hora de querer no hace falta una desilusion

Que no se puede querer con inteligencia

Si necesitas verme cuanto antes
Ya no llores, voy a tu corazón
Si te hace falta niña acariciarme
No te tardes, entrégate al amor
Yo soy el mismo, en nada he cambiado
No vivo en las nubes como te han contado

No te enfades, así es el corazón
Cuando hay amor no puede haber culpables
Simplemente, la reconciliación
Sólo recuerda que no cabe el odio
Entre dos amigos que un día fueron novios
Recuérdalo, no me olvides, no

Siempre, que te falte amor mío

Ven a mi lado cuando sientas frío
Siempre, que te asalte la duda
Y a tu alma desnuda le falte amor

Fue mi media mitad
Un sabor conocido
Que me dio mucho más
Que quitar su vestido
Se encargó de prender la luz
Para ver mi alma
Y se enamoró
Como en los cuentos de hadas

Fue mi media mitad
Y yo sólo su amigo
Y hoy me cuesta pensar
Que esté todo perdido

Se cansó de esperar el sol
Sobre su ventana
Y hoy me duele su adios
Justo cuando mi corazón
Decide atraparla

Y se me fue su amor, como un elevador
Cuando no tengo alas
Y ya no alumbra el sol, tan solo lluvia cae
Sobre mi ventana
Y pesa más su adiós que si llevara al mundo
Sobre mis espaldas
Como explicarle que también yo la amaba

Fue mi media mitad
Y yo un ciego perdido
Que veía en su amor
Mi bastón preferido

Se cansó de esperar el sol
Sobre su ventana
Y hoy me duele su adios
Justo cuando mi corazón
Decide atraparla

Y se me fue su amor, como un elevador
Cuando no tengo alas
Y ya no alumbra el sol, tan solo lluvia cae
Sobre mi ventana
Y pesa más su adiós que si llevara al mundo
Sobre mis espaldas
Como explicarle que también yo la amaba (ooh)
Que también yo la amaba

(Como explicarle a mi alma, me siento perdido, esto es un castigo; ella fue mi media mitad)
No he podido encontrar
Quién me dé mucho más
Que quitar su vestido
(Como explicarle a mi alma, me siento perdido, esto es un castigo; ella fue mi media mitad)
Como explicarle a mi alma
Cuando me pida el cariño
(Como explicarle a mi alma, me siento perdido, esto es un castigo; ella fue mi media mitad)
Fue mi media mitad
Y me duele pensar que se haya ido

(Como explicarle a mi alma, me siento perdido, esto es un castigo; ella fue mi media mitad)
Sentado en mi ventana lloviendo
Tan solo lloro y me digo
(Como explicarle a mi alma, me siento perdido, esto es un castigo; ella fue mi media mitad)
Me siento tan mal
Desde que se fue
Me falta su amor
Me siento un mendigo
(Como explicarle a mi alma, me siento perdido, esto es un castigo; ella fue mi media mitad)
No supe entregar a tiempo el corazón
Y ya la he perdido

Dime cosas esta noche que duelan
Hazme cosas esta noche que me hieran
Que hoy por fin he decidido terminar con este amor
Ya lo nuestro es tan solo una rutina
Ya lo nuestro se ha tornado cada día
En un cielo tan oscuro que ya nunca tendrá sol
Compréndeme, ya lo intente
Desde hace tiempo el decirte la verdad
No creas que yo siempre mentí
Tu sabes bien que fuiste todo, todo en mi
Pero nunca uno sabe del mañana
Del amor que ayer sentí no queda nada
Es difícil admitirlo pero es la realidad
Escúchame, yo contigo ya no encuentro la alegría
(Ya lo pensé)
Ya en lo nuestro sé perdió la fantasía
(Será mejor)
Llorar un rato y olvidar, que continuar
Yo te veré en la otra vida
La nuestra ya esta perdida
Es muy difícil el aceptarlo
Adiós amor, adiós, adiós mi vida
Ahora mi iré, no te imaginas
Esta, esta tristeza(espero me perdones)
Te quise tanto pero lo siento
Ahora no, no te quiero
Dime cosas esta noche que me hieran
Hazme cosas esta noche que me duelan
Que hoy por fin he decidido terminar con este amor
""Compréndeme, de este amor no queda nada""
Comprende que un día te quise mujer
Pero con el tiempo todo se acaba
Compréndeme, compréndeme, de este amor no queda nada
Pero nunca te mentí
Y en la cara hoy te lo quiero decir
Compréndeme, compréndeme, de este amor no queda nada
No tienes la culpa ni tampoco yo si el amor que existía
El viento se lo llevo
No queda na', compréndelo
Ay, ya no queda nada
Comprénde que lo intente
Ay, ya no queda nada
Pero el amor que tenia que tu lo ve, tu lo ve
Ay, ya no queda nada
Si sabes que te quise con el alma
Hoy te lo voy a decir
Ay, ya no queda nada
Que no quiero más cariño y no quiero saber de ti
Ay, ya no queda nada
Compréndelo de una vez, que ya todo se termina
Si es muy cierto que te quise, pero llego la rutina
Y no quiero mas saber de ti, no quiero de tu cariño
Si ya no soy aquel niño, que engañaba tu dulzura
Por eso ya no quiero amor, si señor, que ya no quiero mas tu ternura
Vete corazón, vete corazón, que ya desperté de tu maldita ilusión
Es cierto que yo te amaba, pero todo termino
No quiero na'...que no quiero seguir
Ya no te quiero mas...y todo llego a su fin
No quiero na'...y es cierto que yo te quise
Ya no te quiero mas...pero cure cicatrices
No quiero na'...ya no quiero mas, ya no quiero mas
Ya no te quiero mas...Seguire un mundo de rutina y de soledad
No quiero na'...Que ya no quiero vivir
Ya no te quiero mas...pero prefiero morir
No quiero na'...Si he de regresar contigo
Ya no te quiero mas... sin vergüenza te lo digo
Ohhh se acabo
Ohh termino
Ya lo nuestro se acabo!

I don't know the way back to the place where our love lies
Blindfolded, it feels, when we try to see out to the sunlight

I used to love with my eyes closed
But now it seems that we just keep

So we just keep dancing around every day
And we just keep playing the same guessing games
And we both know we'll never go back to the start
If we just keep throwing darts in the dark

Darts in the dark
I don't know the way back to your heart
I don't know the way back to the dark

I remember you, I just cannot seem to find your love
'Cause lately, darling, darkness is the moon between us

I used to love with my eyes closed
But now it seems that we just keep

So we just keep dancing around every day
And we just keep playing the same guessing games
And we both know we'll never go back to the start
If we just keep throwing darts in the dark

Darts in the dark
I don't know the way back to your heart
I don't know the way back to the dark

Throwing darts in the dark, somebody's gonna get hurt
Throwing darts in the dark, only gonna make things worse
I will never find the center of your heart
If I keep throwing darts in the dark, throwing darts in the dark

I got dreams, y'all (talk about it)
Big old pie in the sky, hopes are high
Crazy dreams, y'all (talk about it)
Bucket list full of ignorance is bliss
And fancy little things, y'all, twinkling in my eye
Hoping that I live to see it all before I die

I heard about the power of intention
Did I forget to mention, I just wanna get paid

Said I just wanna get paid, 'cause I'm worth it
A million dollars a day, I deserve it

I got needs, y'all (talk about it)
I'm in debt to my knees from tuition and fees
From my degrees, y'all (talk about it)
And my skills should pay the bills
But I still got a couple mouths to feed, y'all
And they ask me all the time:
(""Daddy, why do we always gotta stand in this line?"")

Momma looking good in some jeans all ripped
Got a baby in her belly and a baby on her hip
Little toe headed rascal peeing off the porch
Daddy got a shotgun looking for a stork
Oh lord

Bible by the bed and a bottle sitting pretty
Pigskin on the TV, bacon in a skillet
An ol' mutt in the yard lickin' on an itch
Bunch of fake flamingos flocking by the ditch

{Verse 1}
Spend a little too much time together
Forgotten how to be all by ourselves
Could be worse, yeah it could be better
Stay inside beyond all others
Help won’t get me out of bed
Stop the voices in my head
Waste away with you instead alone, alone
The great inside and fortitude
Safely home alone with you
Wasting time but what a view you are
{Pre-Chorus}
Nobody told me when you love someone for real
That your mind’s on hold and your heart’s behind the wheel
{Chorus}
I'm so caught up with you
Slow love in solitude
Don't eat and we drink too much
Four walls and that one room love
We’ll drift away again
You give me something to numb the pain
We don't talk and we keep the door shut
We’re together just a little too much
{Bridge}
I'll lay awake in the middle of the night thinking about home
Feel so alone though I'm with you
Not the same as I used to be
My friends all lost touch with me
And there's nobody to blame but myself
{Pre-Chorus}
Nobody told me when you love someone for real
That your mind’s on hold and your heart’s behind the wheel
{Chorus}
I'm so caught up with you
Slow love in solitude
Don't eat and we drink too much
Four walls and that one room love
We’ll drift away again
You give me something to numb the pain
We don't talk and we keep the door shut
We’re together just a little too much

Don't eat and we drink too much

Que, te has vuelto a enamorar?
Te han contado que te quiere como a nadie
Y que no te hace mal
Si, me alegro en realidad
Merecias un amor que te quisiera y te supiera valorar
Que, te he visto por ahi
Caminabas en sus brazos sonriendo y luces muy feliz
Si, mereces lo mejor
Pero no puedo entender que tu alegria a mi me cause tal dolor
No te vayas, no te voy a reprochar
Una cosa solo quiero preguntar
Como puedes olvidarte de lo nuestro
Y yo no puedo hacer igual
He tratado de olvidarte en otro amor
Y no puedo
He tratado de arrancarme de la piel aquellos besos
He tratado de encontrar un nuevo amor
En otro cuerpo
Y lo unico que hago es recordar
Que no te tengo
Que no te tengo
No te vayas, no te voy a reprochar
Una cosa solo quiero preguntar
Como puedes olvidarte de lo nuestro
Y yo no puedo hacer igual
He tratado de olvidarte en otro amor
Y no puedo
He tratado de arrancarme de la piel aquellos besos
He tratado de encontrar un nuevo amor
En otro cuerpo
Y lo unico que hago es recordar
Que no te tengo
Que no te tengo
He tratado de olvidarte y yo no puedo
He tratado de olvidarte y te juro que no puedo
He tratado de olvidarte y yo no puedo
Es que....
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Olvidarte en otro cuerpo y otra piel
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Solo me hace recordar tus instintos de mujer
Es que no puedo, no puedo
No puedo, no puedo y no puedo, no puedo olvidarte
He tratado de olvidarte y yo no puedo
He tratado
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Arrancarme de mi mente esos besos del pasado
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Solo te pido pensando en tu cuerpo y te juro mujer que te amo
Es que no puedo, no puedo
No puedo no, y no puedo no, y no puedo no, y no puedo no
He tratado de olvidarte y yo no puedo
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Arrancarme de los labios esos besos de tu boca
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Si tan solo con mirarte, esa furia me provoca
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Yo no puedo seguir, un minuto sin ti
Es que no puedo, no puedo
Si sabes que eres mi anhelo, yo te juro que me muero
Es que no puedo, es que no puedo olvidarte
Es que no puedo, es que no puedo olvidarte
Es que no puedo, es que no puedo olvidarte
Es que no puedo, es que no puedo olvidarte
Es que no puedo, es que no puedo olvidarte

No sé decir te quiero ,pero me entrego
Pocas palabras al hablar, pero sincero
Uno que otro defecto, eso lo acepto
Quizás no el indicado, pero me ofrezco
No soy el sol que quema, pero caliento
No sé de poesías, pero enternezco
De pronto un poco tosco, pero acaricio
Y quererte a ti así, ese es mi vicio
Busca por dentro
Que pongo en juego todos mis sentimientos
Un beso y un abrazo exacto en el momento
Que me lo pidas, me lo pidas
Busca por dentro amor
Que hay una fuente inagotable de agua fresca
Y una llama que no dejo nunca que se apague
Y un corazón lleno de amor en mi equipaje
Busca por dentro amor
Y llega como yo al total convencimiento
Escampa tus dudas en mis adentros
Que de ternura estoy hecho por dentro
No se lo que es ganar, pero lo intento
Tal ves no arriesgo mucho, pero me atrevo
Sino me determinan, desconozco
Si me toca perder, lo reconozco
Le tengo miedo al mar, pero navego
Temo a la oscuridad, pero soporto
Ante la soledad yo me acongojo
Y como todo ser que vive río y lloro
Busca por dentro
Que pongo en juego todos mis sentimientos
Un beso y un abrazo exacto en el momento
Que me lo pidas, que me lo pidas
Busca por dentro amor
Que hay una fuente inagotable de agua fresca
Y una llama que no dejo nunca que se apague
Y un corazón lleno de amor en mi equipaje
Busca por dentro amor
Y llega como yo al total convencimiento
Escampa tus dudas en mis adentros
Que de ternura, estoy hecho por dentro
Busca en mis entrañas, busca un poco más
Sin miedo a la oscuridad que te esperaré
Abrázame, entrégate a mí
Que quiero compartir contigo, toda la esencia
Toda la esencia de este amor
Busca en mis entrañas, busca un poco más
Sin miedo a la oscuridad que te esperaré
No lo pienses, no, no, no
Cuando quieras, un beso que queda ahí es definitivo
Definitivo para mí

Ain't there something I can give you
In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind and make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out
Of reach
The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea
We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes I tell you now, that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, honey
Everybody's got opinions
'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again
We love so strong and so unselfishly
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, baby
They don't bother me, said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, listen baby
Somebody understands me
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long
Always on my own, now I'm home
My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone, I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever
We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I made a vow so I tell you now
I'm giving you the best that I got, listen baby
I bet everything on my wedding ring
I'm giving you the best that I got
Givin' it to you baby

My bruises shine

Hoping it stays dry
Feet cast in solid stone
I've got Gilligan's eyes

Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no
No scrub, love
No scrub, love

No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

See, if you can't spatially expand my horizon
Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never rising
I don't find it surprising and if you don't have the G's
To please me and bounce me here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you something to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular, and then I get back to ya
With diamond-like precision, insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition from your friend's Expedition
Mr. Big Willy, if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho?
Not really, T-Boz and all my señoritas
Are steppin' on your FILA's, but you don't hear me, though

No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride

I want to dance
Clocks strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls

Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I want to dance with somebody

Tumble outta bed
And stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life
Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets
The traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Working 9 to 5
What a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by
It's all taking
And no giving
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...
They let you dream
Just to watch them shatter
You're just a step
On the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat
With a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day
Your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn
An' it's all gonna roll you away

Working 9 to 5
What a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by
It's all taking
And no giving
They just use your mind
And you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life
And you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game
No matter what they call it
And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet

From a black widow's reckoning
Your fortuitous spine
Opened up like a marionette
Danced a whimsical pride
Lend a hand to the silver blade
Stir your gut 'til it pours
Fill our cups with profanity
'Til the earth is stained orange

How my tongue dried into the dust
How my skin willed a lie
Drill a hole in the field
Just the size of my thighs

Feel as lonely as I do
Feel as lonely as I do
Feel as lonely as I do, as I do
Feel as lonely as I do, I do

Dried up seeds neath our parting seas
Floating pears on the tide
Slow motion to drown me
Roaming streams from our eyes

How my tongue dried into the dust
How my skin willed a lie
Drill a hole in the field
Just the size of my thighs

Feel as lonely as I do
Feel as lonely as I do
Feel as lonely as I do, as I do
Feel as lonely as I do, I do

Hold the pain in a soft crux
With our palms facing up
Push it thoroughly through and through
This is ours to drink up
Oh, the madness in weakness
Doubled o'er on the plate
Fill an ocean with weaponry
Hurricanes of our grace

Yo aquí llorandote un río
Mandándome al olvido
Que cosa mas injusta amor
Fuiste matando mis pasiones
Tachando mis canciones
Me tenías pisoteado
Estaba desahuseado
No es justo no bebé
Oh oh veo

Pero este mundo ya giró
Y ahora te tocó perder
Oh oh veo

Bebé te lloré todo un río (bebé, bebé)
Bebé, te lloré a reventar (bebé, bebé)
Oh no no no, no tienes corazón, oh oh
No te vuelvo a amar
Te lloré todo un río
Ahora llorame un mar
Ya no me busques ya es muy tarde
Ya tengo otro amor
Una chula sirena
Que nada en mi piel
Que te perdono, no hay rencores
Solo los dolores
Mi alma esta arañada
Lloré el suelo mojado
No es justo no bebé
Oh oh veo

Verdad que un río te lloré
Verdad que no te vuelvo a amar
Oh no no no, no te vuelvo a amar

Give me only what I need
It doesn't take too much to keep me satisfied

Hunger's got a way to tame a man's pride

Let's get to work every woman and man

I'm not pining for a starving queen
Tooth and nail will wear any man down
And my Mama keeps telling me I'm lookin' too lean
Can we build it up?
I know that we can

Take me out of this mudslide or never enough
Let me eat from the fruit right off of the tree
When God gets his rest because six days are just too rough
I can only pray he doesn't forget about me

이 밤을 열어 내가 더 먼저
널 만나고 싶은 걸 지금 난 Oh
달빛 차올라

깜짝 놀랄

떠올릴까 봐 지금

혼자선 그리울 밤 밤 밤
견디기 싫어 지금
너를 너를 데리러 가
점점 더 차오른 가쁜 숨이
너와 내 사이를 좁히지
보고 싶단 네 한 마디가
내 맘을 조급하게 해
좀 더 속도를 높여 난
창가의 비처럼
투명히 맺혀 빛나고 있어
숨 가쁜 얘기들도 모두 다 Oh
난 한 걸음 더 다가갈수록
온 세상 모든 게 다 너로 변해 가
난 먼저 알고 싶어 네 모든 순간
저 달빛보다
I can feel
We’re looking at each other
Through this door
Let’s see…
Your eyes nose lips cheek

Are you only being nice because you want something?
My fairy tale arrow pierces
Be careful how you respond, 'cause you might end up in this song
I never gave you an encouragement
And it's doing me in, doing me in, doing me in, doing me in

The more, the more, the more that I appear

Let me run with you tonight
I'll take you on a moonlight ride
There's someone I used to see
But she don't give a damn for me

But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud

You don't know how it feels to be me

People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold

A memory and a dream

And let's head on down the road, there's somewhere I gotta go

He's still tryin' to beat the clock

She calls me from the cold
Just when I was low
Feeling short of stable
All that she intends
And all she keeps inside
Isn't on the label
She says she's ashamed
Can she take me for a while?
Can I be a friend?
We'll forget the past
Or maybe I'm not able
And I break at the bend
We're here and now
Will we ever be again?
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
Away again
She dreams a champagne dream
Strawberry surprise
Pink linen on white paper
Lavender and cream
Fields of butterflies
Reality escapes her
She says that love
Is for fools that fall behind
And I'm somewhere between
I never really know
A killer from a savior
'Til I break at the bend
We're here and now
Will we ever be again?

All of my mouth was kissing him
Now, into the air, I am missing him
Is this excess texting a blessing?
Two music nerds obsessing

He reminds me of the love in me
I'm celebrating on a vibrancy
Sending each other MP3s
Falling in love to a song

This handsomest of wickermen
He asked if I could wait for him
Now, how many lightyears this interim
While I fall in love with his songs?

His hands are good in protecting me
Touching and caressing me
But would it be trespassing
Wanting him to be blissing me
Robbing him of his youth?

Cliffhanger like suspension
My longing has formed its own skeleton
Bridging the gap between singletons
Sending each others these songs

The interior of these melodies
Is perhaps where we are meant to be
Our physical union a fantasy
I just fell in love with a song

So, I reserve my own intimacies
I bundle them up in packages
My rawward longing far too visceral
Did I just fall in love with love?

Reluctantly crouched at the starting line
Engines pumping and thumping in time
The green light flashes, the flags go up
Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup
They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
Fuel burning fast on an empty tank
Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern
As they speed through the finish, the flags go down
The fans get up and they get out of town
The arena is empty except for one man
Still driving and striving as fast as he can

The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns

He's going the distance
He's going for speed
She's all alone
In her time of need
Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
He's going the distance

No trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no wine
He's haunted by something he cannot define
Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force
In his mind, he's still driving, still making the grade
She's hoping in time that her memories will fade
Cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse

The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's striving and driving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns

Goodbye, little Robin-Marie
Don't try following me
Don't cry, little Robin-Marie
'Cause you know I'm coming home soon
My ships' leaving on a three-year tour
The next tide will take us from shore
Windlaced, gather in sail and spray
On a search for the mighty sperm whale
Fly your willow branches
Wrap your body round my soul
Lay down your reeds and drums on my soft sheets
There are years behind us reaching
To the place where hearts are beating
And I know you're the last true love I'll ever meet
And I know you're the last true love I'll ever meet
Starbuck's sharpening his harpoon
The black man is playing his tune
An old salt's sleeping his watch away
He'll be drunk again before noon
Three years sailing on bended knee
We found no whales in the sea
Don't cry, little Robin-Marie
'Cause we'll be in sight of land soon
Fly your willow branches
Wrap your body round my soul
Lay down your reeds and drums on my soft sheets

Baby girl shake a little faster, shake a little faster, shake a little faster, shake a little faster
All my niggas in here throwing money on the dance floor
Shake a little faster, do it, do it
I said shake a little faster, shake a little faster, shake a little faster, shake a little faster
When lil mama walk by make my head turn backwards
Shake a little faster

I call her all the booty shawty, guacamole army
All the tricks she doing man, she make a nigga horny
Her partner said she want me, my buddy say she’s crazy
Every single night she try to pull up cuz she faded
Pussy is amazing so every night I answer
Damn I might be trippin, might be in love with a dancer
I told her shake it for the camera
She too much to handle
Damn you moving slow, I told her shake a little faster

He ain’t let that money fly, nigga then you got to go
Plus have something to look on
Don’t stop popping hoe
Shake a little faster, I hate it when you do it slow
In the club with all the dope boys, they think I'm selling coke
Any time shawty walk by lil mama turn heads
At the end of the night she countin up the bread

Baby girl shake a little faster, shake a little faster, shake a little faster, shake a little faster

Mile high club baby don't jump out the plane yet
Just might fall in love
I can tell the way you grip
Me, I don't even have to trip
Dripping so long I bet the neighbors know your name
They just might call the hotel
Maybe we should dip
Vegas, a wedding on the strip right now

I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know what would happen if we kiss right now
I wanna know, I wanna know
Right here and right now
I wanna know, I wanna know
Already know but I wanna be sure
Know that I wanna be yours
Right here and right now

On display, just might fall
In a little trouble with the law
Ain't no tellin' what they saw
Windows up in the car all the way
Just might call the hotel
Maybe we could get
A room, then get kicked out again right now

Already know but I wanna be sure

We can stay if you want
I'll just say what you want
I can't wait anymore
I could stay kissing you
I just hate missing you
I might take it from you

Letra de ""Sola""
Otra noche sola en mi cama
Las seis de la mañana y
Tú ni siquiera me llamas (no me llamas)

Ya yo me cansé, dile a tus amigos que se queden contigo
Dile a esas mujeres que te cuiden la casa
Para ser sincera no sé qué hago contigo
¿Qué hago contigo?

Mejor me quedo sola, ah
Y me voy pa' la calle, eh
Voy a vivir mi vida loca, ah
Sin nadie que me falle, eh

Me voy a dar una rumba
Voy a ver lo que me tiene el mundo
Esta noche salgo sin rumbo
Y de todo me olvidaré
Hasta de tu nombre me olvidaré
Y es que tú no logras entender
Como se trata a una mujer
No vengas con tus cuentos que ya yo me los sé
Ya no me estés llamando que de ti me cansé

(Sola)

Y yo todo te lo di
Sólo vivía por ti
Pero abrí los ojos y me di cuenta que nada es lo que parece
Y que tú no me mereces
Aguanta candela
Ahora aguanta candela
Tú no tenías tiempo para mí
Ahora no tengo tiempo para ti

Ya yo me cansé, dile a tus amigos que se queden contigo
Dile a esas mujeres que te cuiden la casa (vete)
Para ser sincera no sé qué hago contigo
¿Qué hago contigo?

Mejor me quedo sola, ah (solita, solita)
Y me voy pa' la calle, eh
Voy a vivir mi vida loca, ah (loca)
Sin nadie que me falle, eh

(Sola, Sola)

Y tus mentiras yo no voy a escuchar, no
Haz tu vida que yo sigo mi camino, oh
Ya me cansé por todo lo que pasé
Te quite la licencia ya no manejas mi destino, no
Lo siento pero yo no voy a ser tu hobby
De tu juego me retiro como Kobe
Cero sufrimiento
Te quiero, no te miento
Pero el amor no quita conocimiento

Mejor me quedo sola, ah
Y me voy pa' la calle, eh
Voy a vivir mi vida loca, ah
Sin nadie que me falle, eh

Sola
Bailando sola
Viviendo sola

Did I constellate your light right next to mine?

Tengo que confesar que a veces
No me gusta tu forma de ser
Luego te me desapareces
Y no entiendo muy bien por qué
No dices nada romántico
Cuando llega el atardecer
Te pones de un humor extraño
Con cada luna llena al mes
Pero a todo lo demás
Le gana lo bueno que me das
Sólo tenerte cerca
Siento que vuelvo a empezar
Yo te quiero con limón y sal
Yo te quiero tal y como estás
No hace falta cambiarte nada
Yo te quiero si vienes o si vas
Si subes y bajas y no estás
Seguro de lo que sientes
Tengo que confesarte ahora
Nunca creí en la felicidad
A veces algo se le parece
Pero es pura casualidad
Luego me vengo a encontrar
Con tus ojos me dan algo más
Sólo tenerte cerca

I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out if it was
One of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

He told me he built a time machine

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

Can you help the hopeless?
Well, I'm begging on my knees
Can you save my bastard soul?
Will you wait for me?
I'm sorry, brothers, so sorry, lover
Forgive me, father, I love you, mother

Can you hear the silence?

Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel my heart?

I'm scared to get close, and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim
I'm scared to get close, and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

If they gleam in the sun
While they spin and they fit on my truck then (​​I could remember)
And if it came in the sack
No stems no seeds in the bag girl {​​I could remember}​​
And if they drip from my wrist and they look like they shine like new then

I forgot to be your lover
If it wasn't for the 9 to 5
Double-up overtime then (​​I could remember)
If it wasn't for the Sunday All-Star

And the fights keep getting worse (Oh, brother)

And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Oh, no)
When she starts playin' little games
Comin' in late from work

Tú me haces decir que soy afortunada
Tu haces redimir mi ayer con mi mañana
Hoy dejé de vivir abandonada
Yo te quiero decir que sin quererlo
Esta luz encendió un mundo para verlo
Mi universo se llenó sin tú saberlo
De un amor que llegó para siempre quererlo
Lo que yo siento es tan hondo, tan hondo y profundo
Que me da miedo llegar a pensar que no estés
Mejor prefiero quedarme esta noche en segundo
Aunque no sepa que vendrá después
Lo que yo siento es tan hondo, tan hondo y profundo

So you say you like candy canes
All the ladies do
Candy canes were meant for sucking
So don't you think about trying to chew
How about a little eggnog
I got a homemade recipe
You're gonna get love drunk on my eggnog
Even though it's alcohol free
I'm gonna stuff your stocking this year
Gonna fill up nice and tight
Gonna feel so good when I slide my gifts into it tonight
I'm gonna stuff your stocking this year
Gonna fill it up with all I got
Nick nacks and candies gonna hit your stocking g-spot
I know you like your toys, girl
I got toys to fulfill your needs
The kind that only use double d batteries
And run at variable speeds
Gonna stuff it with an iPhone
All I ask is some tit for tat
If you could memorize the Kama Sutra
Heck they probably make an app for that
I'm gonna stuff your stocking this year
Gonna fill it to the tippy top
Gonna take it all out
Then stuff it back in
Take it al out... stuff it back in
You'll never want me to stop
I'm gonna stuff your stocking this year
With holiday love and romance
I just hope that Santa doesn't stuff it
Before I get the chance

Cause I was never good at running away
Till you ran away nothing feels the same
See I was cut between the lighted shape
Through the hours of darkness I found your name
I left my heart in the lowest places
Lost all my graces in midnight flames
See I was never good at running away
Till you ran away, eh eh

When are you coming home?
I'm tired of missing you when you're gone
If distance makes our hearts grow stronger
We'll live longer
But I'm dying to know
When are you coming home?
You coming home?

See I was blinded by the neon lights
Lost my eyes to the angels that sold me lies
Empty promisses and warning signs
Left a light burning out like fireflies
No need to talk, baby it's alright
When the words are right
They keep you up at night
Ooohh ooooooooooh

When are you coming home?
I'm tired of missing you when you're gone
If distance makes our hearts grow stronger
We'll live longer

Come on y'all, let's take a ride
Don't ya say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
Cuz you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab you gat with the extra clip
And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it, kick it, kick it
Yea that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin, ain't no crippin
Ain't no punk ass niggas set trippin'
Everybody got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black
I wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank, and I know that I can bring ya
If ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen
We on a mission

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I'm hittin switches on the block in a 65
Come along and ride on fantastic voyage
Slide, slide hoo ride, ain't no valley low enough or mountain high

I'm tryin to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggas
I keep on searchin' and I keep on lookin'
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin' like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Come along and ride on a Fantastic Voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I do what I do just to survive
(Come along and ride on a Fantastic Voyage)
Slide slide hoo ride, that's why I pack my 45

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggas can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot, swing low
Ain't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worryin' everybody's tryin'
Nothing from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have somethin' you better stop frontin'
What you gonna do when the 5 rolls by?
You better be ready so you can ride

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity slide if you're living in the city it's do or die
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride you better be ready for the 5 rolls by
Just roll along (that's what you do)
Just roll along (that's right)
Just roll along (that's what you do)
Just roll along (that's right)

She's a psycho from a Midwest suburb
No straightjacket could hold her
Wild eyes, they would lure me in her trap
I go mad just to hold her

Until I noticed that something was strange
Out of my range, there was no way back
Something went off in my brain
She was insane, here she goes again
A psycho from a Midwest suburb
I woke up and I told her

You won't know me when the feeling's all gone
And I tell everyone
And the look on your face will slowly come undone
'Cause it was all a front
And quietly, I say it to your face
That you will need to find another place to stay
And no you won't know me when the feeling's all gone
And I tell everyone, ay

She's a loose cannon with a temper, so absurd
Hiding from the police, yeah
Took pills with the name I'd never heard
But they were for sleep, she fooled me

El amor sin control, es tan perfecto

Pero es que te protegeré (por eso)
Y todo esto lo hago por ti, si me lo pides
Y yo disparo, es lo que quieres, ¿no?

Why do we always feel like we need to try?
Why do we believe that we need to be somebody else
To feel alive?
Why do we make
Why do we keep making the same mistakes?
And believing that it won't make a difference if we try
To break away

Why do we keep going round and round?

Saturday, empty room, filled with people
It don't mean a thing to
You and I, holding hands
Nobody knows, nobody understands
I don't care for sunlight
That only means it's over
And I'm in no mood for that

Stay tonight
Don't come morning, don't come light
They may be lies, say it, say that we'll be alright
If we stay tonight

My hands are shaking
This is a complicated love with me
Keep your eyes closed, I've seen it baby
I've seen where this goes

Stay tonight
Don't come morning, don't come light
They may be lies, but say that we'll be alright
If we stay tonight

Gonna feel it baby
Oh I don't wanna cry
I know we'll get to tomorrow and say goodbye

Hey love time to get up
I think you’ve been sleeping too long
My day started when you were still yawning
One room just ain’t enough
When it’s two folks trying to get along
But it’s hard to leave you alone

Oh love is always better
When we take time to get back to who we are
When we are apart
Distance makes the heart grow
Even when I’m lonely
Happy knowing that your love is never far
When we are apart
Distance makes the heart

It makes the leaves on the trees fall
It makes the hours in the day long
Makes me wanna clear my head
Find a little cafe and write the words to a song
And I know that I’m still free
Be anywhere that I wanna be
Maybe get dressed up
Wear something real pretty that you ain’t never seen

Oh love is always better
When we take time to get back to who we are
When we are apart
Distance makes the heart grow
Even when I’m lonely
Happy knowing that your love is never far
When we are apart
Distance makes the..

When you love it makes the heart
When you trust it makes the heart
When you call it makes it heart
We’re alone, when we’re apart
In the middle of a fight
Walk away to make it right
Where we go we’re never far
In the light or in the dark
On a plane up in the stars
In a movie or at the bar
Home alone or out to tea
Look to your heart and think of me
I wanna love you
Don’t wanna try to change the pace of your life
We get together we make it good
We get together, ooh..

On this cold and windy Sunday
I'm sitting here alone... It's Autumn
I'm looking at a yellow picture
You have been gone forever
Oh it's so very hard, growing old on your own, alone
I'm trying to remember... the days...
When we were young
Since forever, I still remember your ways
Since forever, I still remember
I have been reading your letter, over and over again
I can't believe you're gonna be here today
I can't believe... this is Sunday
How nice of you to come, it's been so way too long
Let me get you another glass of wine
To keep our tingues in time

Since forever, I still remember your ways
Since forever, I still remember
So many things have never been told
And now the both of us are way too old
Solo: Shermann
Since forever, I still remember your ways
Since forever, I still remember
Like the light of the sun
You used to brightened my day
But darkness ha taken your place
And I can no longer keep it away
Since forever, I still remember your ways
Since forever, I still remember
I ask you for one last time
No there won't be any wine

Ja, jag rimmar på från undergroundnivå
Jag siktar mot toppen så långt jag kan nå
Och jag kommer in rullar hårt i Stockholmsterräng
Det är titeln jag vill åt
Jag är, jag är

Från Slussen, Hornstull, Zinkensdamm, Vietnam
Samma stam huliganer var kleptomaner
Mickpyromaner, kumpaner
Blowar som ett gäng militanta veganer
1200-kattare, barnackade skytjackare
Riktiga rimslaktare
Respekt till alla snubbar som hängt sen dag ett
Ni finns i familjen där mitt blod flyter fett
Klä bilder med ord bevittna saker som jag sett
För rim faller tätt när jag förklarar vad som gäller
Som blöta akvareller

Jag börjar pensla, jag flyter med känsla

Ja, jag rimmar på från undergroundnivå
Jag siktar mot toppen så långt jag kan nå
Och jag kommer in rullar hårt i Stockholmsterräng

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Maybe I'll lose, maybe I'll leave the game
Something calling, don't know where I'm going

Seen some heart aches, weighed me down like a stone

When you're driving down the highway at night
And you're feeling that wild turkey's bite
Don't give johnny walker a ride
Cause jack black is right by your side
You might get taken to the jailhouse and find
You've been arrested for driving while blind
Now just the other night with nothing to do
We broke a case of proof 102
And started itching for that wonderful feel
Of rolling in an automobile
You could say we was out of our mind
And let me tell you we were flying while blind
Then they had us up against the wall
Hey it's only blood grain alcohol
And there ain't no cause for alarm
We ain't out to do nobody no harm
How could anyone be so unkind
To arrest a man for driving while blind

Perdiendo el tiempo implorando clemencia
Los tengo a to llorando, los tá matando la impaciencia
Dice Forever, quién te canta, chamaco
No queda vivo tu talento barato
Si tu te metes a guarachar por un rato
Pero a final de cuentas te la aplico, novato
Represen, 100% yo aplomo
Lo que he logrado lo logramos solos

Paroles de la chanson Todavia :
Como pasa el tiempo desde aquellos días
En que era mi vida, la tuya y la mía
Lejos de tus besos inventando un sueño
Y yo no sabía que al volverte a ver
Todo aquel querer que yo te tenia
Sigue vivo en mí, sigue todavía
Todavía, todavía amo a esa mujer como no sabia
Todavía, todavía amo a esa mujer, todavía
Aunque van los pasos buscando alegría
A veces te encuentras la tristeza herida
Sobre el mar el viento
Viajando en misterios y yo sin saber
Que al volverte a ver todo aquel querer
Que yo te tenía sigue vivo en mi, sigue todavía
Todavía todavía amo a esa mujer todavía
Todavía todavía aunque nada puedo hacer
Porque esa mujer vive hoy otra vida

I couldn't speak so I slurred while I looked for a word
But you left just before I could find it
I sat by myself and I stared at the pictures of you on the wall

I kissed the floor, curled up in a ball
There's nothing coming out of my mouth so I said nothing at all

Babe, you've got a face like thunder
Always trying to get out with another
Just stay still 'til I say it's over
Babe, you've got a face like thunder

And you question your lover, did she really believe
That this new taste of love is obsolete? -
It just couldn't compete and so you’ll keep dragging your body through life by the hair so you can say that you've been somewhere and you don't care of your receipt
You're sentenced to death and you can't be reprieved

Babe, you've got a face like thunder
Always trying to get out with another
Just stay still 'til I say it's over
Babe, you've got a face like thunder

Say sorry for a while, for a while, for a while

I said something terrible and I tried to redeem it

Veux-tu venir avec moi
On s'en va où tu veux
Mais laisse-moi t'arracher de ceux
Qui s'inventent des dieux

Si je t'emmenais dans le bois
L'endroit où t'es le mieux
Pis après deux bonnes bouffées d'air
Tu me diras c'que j'peux faire

Parce que là, tu t'enfonces
Et j'ai pas de réponse
Tu fabules, tu délires
Et je sais pas quoi t'dire
Tu trembles, tu maigris
T'as le teint pâle et gris
Tu changes et je m'ennuie
De mon meilleur ami

Moi, je fais quoi, je fais quoi?
J'attends de devenir folle pour voir ce que tu vois
Toi, qu'est-ce tu fous, qu'est-ce tu fous?
On dirait qu'tu décolles et que tu deviens fou
Fou, fou

Je découvre la face cachée de ton visage
Comme les traits effacés sous une belle image
Je lis dans tes yeux comme dans un livre ouvert
Et même si tu le refermes, je peux lire au travers

Et là, j'le vois, tu t'enfonces
À chercher des réponses
Tu fabules, tu délires
Plus rien ne te fait rire
Tu mens, tu oublis
T'en dors plus la nuit
Tu bois et quoi encore
En autant que tu perdes le nord

Moi, je fais quoi, je fais quoi?
J'attends de devenir folle pour voir ce que tu vois

Ha Ha Ha Hah, yes yes
Return of the B-boy style
Props to all the B-boys and B-girls in da house
(""Cuz when I'm on the mic I like to speak freely"")
Check it out

I got the vibe, check 1, 2 check 1, 2, 3
Wild with the style, check 1, 2 check 1, 2, 3
Does Jack wreck the rhyme? Hell yeah
(""Cuz when I'm on the mic I like to speak freely"")

Yo, as easy as it may seem MC'ing is not a capa-
Bility for most to possess, you gotta catch up
Take the time to create, construct demonstrate
Set wack MC's straight, drinkin' a V8
I'm like a baseball player on track, got on steel cleats
I represent the conscience styles until it hits the streets
My backbone attack wack poems, got mad rap tones
I destroy fake Madlib beats and Crackerjack poems (Ha-Ha)
It's time for lunch already, yes past lunch
I eat MC's like Captain Crunch, I attack and then punch
Rap in such different styles that's unlike yours
Wack MC's, I'll point you out and point out all of your flaws
All of your jaws get broken, styles no jokin'
Battling straight up battling is what I'm provokin'
But I'll die before these wack MC's infect thee
Hip Hop industry to the point I cannot breathe
But if Wildchild dies before Wildchild wakes
I pray to God to step down and take out all them fake
MC's, pretty please
""Cuz when I'm on the mic I like to speak freely""


Down with the Liks, Jump straight from the bass onto the kicks
Non-freestylin' MC's fall straight down in the pits
My name be Jack, spontaneous freestylist when I catch wreck
Brothers bite me so hard saying my rhymes I ain't even wrote yet
So I take it to the max, take out Fake-Funkin' Jacks
Get to the point as I rock over Madlib bumpin' tracks
""You used to get busy at open mics?"" Nah, I still do
I kill crews, lyrically, spiritually, yo I will do
Anything it takes to bring B-boy style back
And the thanks for you to make ya say my rhyme style's phat
But I'll die before these wack MC's infect the
Hip Hop industry to the point I cannot breathe
But if Wildchild dies before Wildchild wakes
I pray to God to step down and take out all them fake
MC's, pretty please

Racin ‘gainst time, think we’re neck to neck
Got people talking that talk
Copy the rhyme but ain’t in their walk

From on this side it seems like a wall
Rough ride, get me through it some way
Another long flight, make me earn the pay

Flash that smile, it’s an industry of service
Don’t let ‘em  in when your humor’s too low
Never too low
Never too low

There’s A deal I made gonna set me free
Got people lost in their thoughts
A glory sometimes, so I pay the cost
And I call it out when I go

Take it all in ‘cause it’s gone today

But I believe in what I’m here for

It's a Friday, we finally made it
I can't believe I get to see your face
You've been working and I've been waiting
To pick you up and take you from this place

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
Like only we can
Like only we can
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm coming up and I'm loving every minute of it

You be the DJ, I'll be the driver
You put your feet up in the getaway car
I'm flying fast like a, a wanted man
I want you, baby, like you can't understand

Oh, love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
We found a message in a bottle we were drinking
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I hate your guts 'cause I'm loving every minute of it
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I gotta leave ya, it's gonna hurt me
My clothes are dirty and my friends are getting worried
Down there below us, under the clouds
Baby, take my hand and pull me down, down, down, down
And I'll be dreamin' of the next time we can go
Into another serotonin overflow

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm busted up but I'm loving every minute of it
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)

I'm looking for a little love
I'm looking for a little love, oh yeah

Long drive, long night
The best night of my life
With you riding, your hand on my hand
The thought of arriving, kind of feels like, dying
I don’t want, to go home and be, alone
Could we, stay out?
Could you...

Drive a little slower, don’t matter where we’re going
As long as I’m with you, we could take the long way

Chevy Nova, front seat, sofa, getting closer, to you

Drive a little slower; don’t matter where we’re going
As long as I’m with you, we can take the long way
Drive a little slower, not ready to go home
I’d rather stay with you

We could take the long way out, to the country out of town
Let’s get lost; I don’t wanna be found
Let’s get away, now and be careful not to crash
There’s no defrost and we’re steaming the glass
You and the road have a generous shoulder
We can pull over and say we took the long way

Headlights, not strobe lights
I can see you, but not quite
I can feel you inside; the timing is just right
For the moment, I don’t want to go home
Take the long way, Take the long way
Whoah whoah whoah
Take the long way
Whoah whoah whoah

Drive a little slower; don’t matter where we’re going
Take the long way
Drive a little slower; don’t matter where we going now
Take the long way
Drive a little slower; not ready to go home
I’d rather stay with you
We can take the long way

I'm a phoenix in the water
A fish that's learned to fly
And I've always been a daughter
But feathers are meant for the sky
So I'm wishing, wishing further
For the excitement to arrive
It's just I'd rather be causing the chaos
Than laying at the sharp end of this knife

With every small disaster
I'll let the waters still
Take me away to some place real

'Cause they say home
Is where your heart is set in stone
Is where you go when you're alone
Is where you go to rest your bones
And it's not just where you lay your head
It's not just where you make your bed
As long as we're together
Does it matter where we go?

So when I'm ready to be bolder
And my cuts have healed with time
Comfort will rest on my shoulder
And I'll bury my future behind
I'll always keep you with me
You'll be always on my mind
But there's a shining in the shadows
And I'll never know unless I try

With every small disaster
I'll let the waters still
Take me away to some place real

If all I had was a dollar and your bright smile
I'd have a dollar more than I would need to get by
'Cause I'm a billionaire if you count every sunrise
Wakin' by your side, and every good night
If all you had was the way that I love you
You'd have more honey than the honey bees in June
I'll keep you laughin', keep you smilin', keep your dreams true
Long as I have you, nothin' we can't do

Fly me
Back to the moon, where you took me
The very first time that you kissed me
In the sweet starlight, of your endless eyes, when you lit this fire
Feels like
We're sittin' on top of a goldmine
Flame so bright that it won't die
In a billion years, it'll still be here
'Cause our love is a goldmine
Yeah, our love is a goldmine

If everything we ever owned disappeared today
We'd build a castle in the sand somewhere far away
Don't need no money, no TV, don't need no microwave
Just the ocean waves, and the love we make

Fly me
Back to the moon where you took me
The very first time that you kissed me
In the sweet starlight, of your endless eyes, when you lit this fire
Feels like
We're sittin' on top of a goldmine
Flame so bright that it won't die
In a billion years it'll still be here
'Cause our love is a goldmine

We'll be rich in wrinkles, old and gray
When the risin' tide sweeps us away
Until then

Fly me
Back to the moon where you took me
The very first time that you kissed me
In the sweet starlight, of your endless eyes, when you lit this fire
Feels like
We're sittin' on top of a goldmine
Flame so bright that it won't die

Oh but now I'm so cold when they kiss me, they touch me, they freeze

Why'd you never let 'em in?
Why'd you wake up with somebody in your bed again?
And say you love them till you leave
Why you out so late
Dancing with your fake friends
Getting in a state?
When the good guys come why'd you run away?
Why'd you hurt them?

Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right, yeah

And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry

No quiero separarme de ti
Ni siquiera un momento
No quiero perder el tiempo
Tu sabes que te quiero a morir
Que no soy de aspavientos
Y que me gusta lento
Ay! Llévame despacio que no hay prisa
Ve dejando en mi camisa una ruta de besos
Que me lleve al mismo cielo
Ay! Pégate sin miedo con malicia
Lléname de tu sonrisa el corazón
A ritmo de tu cuerpo
Lento, baílame lento

Vem cá menina, não me deixe
Lento, cierra los ojos
Y vivamos el momento
Baila conmigo hasta que veas salir el sol

Yo me pierdo en tu cuerpo
Tú me quemas con tu fuego
En tu cintura quiero vivir

Y que me beses lento

You walk by the magazines
Sitting on the rack at the CVS
One more sad movie star divorce
Three hundred died in an airplane wreck
And you think of all the people suffering
And you bury that pain
But you can tell me everything
And we’ll ride on that wave

If I was king of the world
You’d be my girl
You wouldn’t have to shed one single tear
Unless you wanted to
‘Cause yeah I know what it’s like
If I was king of the world
Yeah, girl
We could ride a Greyhound all the way to the Galapagos
And stay for the rest of our lives(ooohh ohhhh ohhhh ohhh)

Dad hit you on the hand
Just for holding your chopsticks wrong
Then your Mom locked you in a shed
And Uncle Sam dropped an atom bomb
But you’re not alone
You can let it go
And just weep on my breast
And cover me with your tenderness
And that pain will pass

Sometimes I think of us, before it all got bad
It left me long ago, the kind of love we had

Left me dry, running on empty vows
But you seemed fine when we met last night
Heard what you were saying, saying, saying
Wasn't your fault

The way that it burns, glass under my nails
An itch, I can't scratch when I hear your name
My baby got me sleep deprived
So what you saying, what you saying now?
When it was we, I played like a child
But now that it's gone I'm fucked up inside
My baby got me sleep deprived
So what you saying, what you saying now?

Don't wanna hold a grudge, still it is hard sometimes
So if you settle down, I'm gonna burn your house

Left me dry, running on empty vows
But you seemed fine and I just don't know how
Heard what you were saying, saying, saying
Wasn't your fault

But now that it's gone I'm fucked up inside

I wanna taste your lips, without the bittersweet
He's here now I can't sleep
So what you saying, what you saying

The way that it burns, glass under my nails
An itch, I can't scratch when I hear your name
My baby got me sleep deprived

Fue un placer conocerte
Y tenerte unos meses;
Aunque esos meses fueron
El principio y el fin
De un amor tan bonito;
Aunque no me quisiste;
Pero yo sí te quise
Y hoy me tengo que ir
Muy feliz fui contigo
Me conformo con nada
Y hoy te quedas sin mí
Y a pesar de que nunca
Me dijiste 'te quiero'
Hoy, que tengo que irme
Me demuestras tu amor
Pero tengo que irme
Porque ya no te quiero
No sé por qué motivo:
Cosas del corazón
Fue un placer conocerte
Y tenerte unos meses;
Aunque esos meses fueron
El principio y el fin
De un amor tan bonito;
Aunque no me quisiste;
Pero yo sí te quise
Y hoy me tengo que ir
Si me hubieras querido
Cuando yo te pedía
Que me amaras un poco
Que me hicieras feliz
Yo me hubiera quedado
Para siempre contigo;
Pero no fue posible
Y hoy me tengo que ir

Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes, these feelings can be so misleading
She turns and says, ""Are you alright?""
I said, ""I must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating.""
""Come and kiss me by the riverside
Bobby says it's fine, he don't consider it cheating.""

Red hair with a curl
Mello-Roll for the flavor
And the eyes were peeping
Can't keep away from the girl
These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting

Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new, yeah
I said it once before
But it bears repeating, now

Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing

Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails

So don't get any big ideas

Fui a la discoteca a ver si me conseguía una fresca
Got myself some rum
Cause where I'm from sometimes you need some
Me tomé mi trago y una princesa pasó por mi lado
La miré con ganas con esa carita de fama
Ella miró OH SI! Ella pasó OH NO!
Ella se volvió con una sonrisa
Tengo que bailar con esa muñequita
La invitó y puso brinca
Y enseguida quise jalarla pa' la pista

Okey, tanto, encontré otra chica que estaba mejor
Bailamos tres merengues de corrido y gozamos
Luego nos sentamos, ordenamos bebidas y conversamos
She look good, so of course I lied all my girls from the hood
Ella preguntó si tenía novia y yo dije no
Me quité el anillo, despacito me lo metí en el bolsillo
Vino un descarado y me dijo : ¡Jo!...¿Tú no eres casado?
Me quedé pasmado y enseguida se la llevó de mi lado

Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said, “You're holding back”
She said, “Shut up and dance with me”
This woman is my destiny
She said, “Oooooh, shut up and dance with me”

We were victims of the night
A chemical, physical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together

She took my arm, I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

""Oh, don't you dare look back

I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together

We took the floor and she said

I realize this is my last chance

She looked like a God
And threw back in my face

Do you remember when word was bond
A fleeting promise in the light of the dawn
Barren December under a falling sky
The end of days and a reason to die
Obliteration never looked so divine
Holding your breath for the moment in time
You lived through hell, now you're trying to die
The skin is healed but you're bleeding inside
Shots fired just to numb the pain
There's no one left to save
Night blind on the shining path
Ghost walking in the aftermath
Hypnotized, 60 cycle hum
The broken cadence of a distant drum
21 to 1 I'm liking the odds
A blood junkie with a lightning rod
A dirty rig and a heavenly nod
And still you wind up nowhere
Obliteration never looked so divine
Holding your breath for the moment in time
You lived through hell, now you're trying to die
The skin is healed but you're bleeding inside
Shots fired just to numb the pain
There's no one left to save
There's no one left to save
There's no one left to save
You
You chase the dragon but it follows you home
Now
You lost the fever dreams and broken hope
Lost
Desolation never looked so divine
Promise yourself for the very last time
You lived through hell, now you're trying to die
The skin is healed but you're bleeding inside
Shots fired just to numb the pain
There's no one left to save
There's no one left to save
(Ohhh...) There's no one left

There's no one left to save
Shots forever end the pain

Can you tell from the look in our eyes

We live our lives like we're ready to die

Can you tell from the look in our eyes

We live our lives like we're ready to die

I thought I'd buried you and covered the tracks
You'll have to take this with your cold dead hands
I thought I'd buried you, what's dead can never die
I thought I'd cut you loose, severed the feeling
I slipped through the cracks, and you caved in my ceiling
I thought I'd buried you, what's dead can never die, fuck

Can you tell from the look in our eyes

We live our lives like we're ready to die

You can run, but you'll never escape

Will we ever see the end?

This is sempiternal
Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal
Over and over, again and again
Rise from the dead you say?
Secrets don't sleep till they're took to the grave
Signal the sirens, rally the troops
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the moment of truth

Can you tell from the look in our eyes

El silencio entre nosotros empieza a dolernos de más
Creo que llegó el momento de dejar todo atrás
No busquemos salida, si nunca quisimos entrar
No recuerdo un domingo de lluvia besándonos en el sofá

Porque nunca fuimos buenos en amar
Porque nunca nos quisimos amarrar

Si yo tuviera la llave, de tus ojos cerrados
Si yo pudiera inventar cada recuerdo, cada abrazo
Si hoy encuentro respuestas y descubro la cura
Al final de la historia no habrá guerras, ni armaduras
Ni armaduras…

Sabes bien que llevo un tiempo buscando la forma de hablar
Sé que juegas a escondidas, nunca lo vas a aceptar
¿De qué sirve esta mentira, cuando siempre te di mi verdad?
Esto no es un simulacro, esta herida nos puede matar

Porque nunca fuimos buenos en amar
Porque nunca nos quisimos amarrar

Si yo tuviera la llave, de tus ojos cerrados
Si yo pudiera inventar cada recuerdo, cada abrazo
Si hoy encuentro respuestas y descubro la cura
Al final de la historia no habrá guerras, ni armaduras

Sube...

Siempre hemos tratado de avanzar
Si caías, caía contigo detrás
En silencio siguen creciendo las dudas
En silencio yo las dejaba desnudas
Y si yo tuviera la combinación
Abriría lo que el dolor ha cerrado
La solución perfecta para esta ecuación
Y romper de tus ojos el candado

Si yo tuviera la llave, de tus ojos cerrados
Si yo pudiera inventar cada recuerdo, cada abrazo
Si hoy encuentro respuestas y descubro la cura
Al final de la historia no habrá guerras, ni armaduras
Ni armaduras…

Thunder on the mountain, fires on the moon
There's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go
I was thinking' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying
When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be
I have been looking for her even clear through Tennessee
Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand
You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away
The writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what it say
Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum
Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from
I don't need any guide, I already know the way
Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day
The pistols are poppin' and the power is down
I'd like to try something' but I'm so far from town
The sun keeps shining'
And the North Wind keeps picking up speed
Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need
I've been sitting down studying the art of love
I think it will fit me like a glove
I want some real good woman to do just what I say
Everybody got to wonder
What's the matter with this cruel world today
Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing
Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages
I been to St. Herman's church and I've said my religious vows
I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows
I got the porkchops, she got the pie
She ain't no angel and neither am I
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams
Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
Mean old twister bearing down on me
All the ladies of Washington scrambling to get out of town
Looks like something bad gonna happen
Better roll your airplane down
Everybody's going and I want to go too
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
I did all I could and I did it right there and then
I've already confessed – no need to confess again
Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself

She’s tried on everything
Everything little thing inside her closet
And she knows it’s getting late
Knows that I’ve been waiting and I’m starving
Cause we’ve been working overtime
She wants to make a night that we’ll remember
And I’m staring at the time
Thinking it’s alright, put on whatever

But I’ve been on my best behavior
Pacing back and forth
And ten thousand lifetimes later
When she walks through the door, I say...

I said hey you with the red dress on
I gotta find a way to take it off
I got a lot of love and it's growing strong
When I see you with your red dress on
You in that red dress
You in that red dress

It’s hard to concentrate
""Finish up your plate""
She whispers to me
But I’ve got one thing on my mind
As they pour the wine
And it consumes me

But I’ve been on my best behavior
Not to cause a scene
But when we finally get home later
It’s just you and me, and I say

And I said hey you with the red dress on
I gotta find a way to take it off
I got a lot of love and it's growing strong
When I see you with your red dress on
Hey you with the red dress on
I gotta find a way to take it off
I got a lot of love and it's growing strong
When I see you with your red dress on
You in that red dress
You

Hey you with the red dress on
I said hey you with the red dress on

Hey you with the red dress on
I gotta find a way to take it off
I got a lot of love and it's growing strong
When I see you with your red dress on

Que, te has vuelto a enamorar?
Te han contado que te quiere como a nadie
Y que no te hace mal
Si, me alegro en realidad
Merecias un amor que te quisiera y te supiera valorar
Que, te he visto por ahi
Caminabas en sus brazos sonriendo y luces muy feliz
Si, mereces lo mejor
Pero no puedo entender que tu alegria a mi me cause tal dolor
No te vayas, no te voy a reprochar
Una cosa solo quiero preguntar
Como puedes olvidarte de lo nuestro
Y yo no puedo hacer igual
He tratado de olvidarte en otro amor
Y no puedo
He tratado de arrancarme de la piel aquellos besos
He tratado de encontrar un nuevo amor
En otro cuerpo
Y lo unico que hago es recordar
Que no te tengo
Que no te tengo
No te vayas, no te voy a reprochar

No it's never on the day you leave
That you wonder what you still believe in
And you can't remember why you said goodbye
You'll hear an old familiar sound and hope it's her when you turn around
But never, never on the day you leave

Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything

No it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it's gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never, never on the day you leave

Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell
Then force herself to like some other man

No it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store Christmas tree
But never, never on the day you leave
No never, never on the day you leave

So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says maybe we're not perfect
But I'll be damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave

Half a mind to leave the ground
Our days like silk, all spun around
You kept me close, one inch off the cosmos
Where you're never alone

Blue wings to lift me up
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
Under the wire comes my love
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
Blue wings to lift me up
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
Under the wire comes my love
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)

All my fears in a steam room stall
I sweat and sweat 'til I've had enough
'Til I'm in first place
'Til our horse comes out ahead
And my chest is full

Blue wings to lift me up
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
Under the wire comes my love
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)

(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
Under the wire comes my love

You wake up late, you feel your heart begin to work
And now you're all dressed up of course
And hailing cabs out of your door
On 14th Street I feel my head between my knees
And orange swimming through the trees
And orange swimming through the trees
Where could I go? What could I do?
Put in the state, my lips and eyes give me away
And now there’s nothing, I can say no
I'm pulled away, I see another of myself
Who's found true love and happiness
To sit and smoke there on the chair for

Two boys, one to kiss your neck
And one to bring you breakfast
Get you out of bed when
You're sore from the night before
From knocking on my door
Your head against the floor boards
Two boys, one to love you sweetly
One does so discreetly
Never will he meet me
But I'm sure that you'll catch your breath
You'll sleep into the day
To wake up with sunlight across your room

Before I leave I want to try to go back in time
To just that moment in my life where I should have spoke up but I lied
As I sat there with my jaw open and I smiled
He pulled his sweater off and tried to explain he'd all but given up on love
I'm pulled away, I see another of myself who's found true love and happiness
To sit and smoke there on the chair
Beside the bed I read this past week's New Yorker
And I watch him paint Antarctica, and watch him paint Antarctica

Two boys, one to kiss your neck
And one to bring you breakfast
Get you out of bed when
You're sore from the night before
From knocking at my door
Your head against the floor boards
Two boys, one to love you sweetly
One does so discreetly
Never will he meet me
But I'm sure that you'll catch your breath
You'll sleep into the day

Hay quien encuentra raro que a los 40 no esté casada
Pocos me han desnudado, muchos me hacen la cama
Otros juran que bebo y que en persona no valgo nada
Que hace dos o tres tallas que no entro en mis vaqueros
Y a veces me dan ganas de volverme y decir

Si tú no sabes nada de mí
Ni dónde, ni con quién, ni cuándo
Si cuelgo a Dios o al diablo en la pared
A qué me atreví, lo que nunca haré
¿A cuánto vendes tú la verdad?
¿Quién te dio vela en este entierro?
No busco un clavo ardiendo
Y si miro atrás tú no estás ahí
Con los que pondrán la mano en el fuego por mí

Nadie conoce a nadie, muchos no entienden de lo que saben
O afilan un puñal en cada pedestal
¿Dónde están los que ayudan?
¿Quién es el feo, el bueno y el malo?
¿Cuál de los doce es Judas?
¿Quién duerme al otro lado?
¿Quién dijo ""no"" y quién ""sí""?
A quién voy yo a decir

Si tú no sabes nada de mí
Ni dónde, ni con quién, ni cuándo
Si cuelgo a Dios o al diablo en la pared
A qué me atreví, lo que nunca haré
¿A cuánto vendes tú la verdad?
¿Quién te dio vela en este entierro?
No busco un clavo ardiendo
Y si miro atrás tú no estás ahí, ni nunca estarás

Los míos nunca bajan los brazos
Los míos saltan cuando yo salto
Los míos van a estar a mi lado igual si me hago un 3 que si escondo un As
Por ellos yo me tiro a la lona
Por ellos aún da vueltas la noria
Por esos que han nacido
Para creer que morir de amor es vivir de pie

Si tú no sabes nada de mí
Ni dónde, ni con quién, ni cuándo
Si cuelgo a Dios o al diablo en la pared
A qué me atreví, lo que nunca haré
¿A cuánto vendes tú la verdad?
¿Quién te dio vela en este entierro?
No busco un clavo ardiendo
Y si miro atrás tú no estás ahí, y nunca estarás

Si tú no sabes nada de mí
Ni dónde, ni con quién, ni cuándo
Si cuelgo a Dios o al diablo en la pared
A qué me atreví, lo que nunca haré

Wish I was too dead to cry
My self-affliction fades
Stones to throw at my creator
Masochists to which I cater

You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go 'til it bleeds

Wish I was too dead to care
If indeed I cared at all
Never had a voice to protest
So you fed me shit to digest
I wish I had a reason;
My flaws are open season
For this, I gave up trying
One good turn deserves my dying

You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go 'til it bleeds


Wish I'd died instead of lived
A zombie hides my face
Shell forgotten
With its memories
Diaries left
With cryptic entries

You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go 'til it bleeds
You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on:
I'll never live down my deceit

Watch me blow the top off of mics
When I rock it don't stop
Like the burnin' sensation when I drop off this mic
Can't stop this for life
The rappin' that is
If I came wack, it'd hurt me more than it'd hurt y'all
Like when parents slap their kids
What's about to happen is
(Nah, what had happened was)
I started making up these tapes, stackin' up my buzz
Rackin' up these dubs, steady packin up the clubs
Is there any other crew who does it quite like us?
Do they make 'em rush the floor?
Ya see that's what counts
Like a club DJ throwin' on More Bounce
And y'all know how we do it over here in L.A
Everybody and they mamma ?
And I say what I mean when I put it in a verse
Rhymes like ? your words would snatch a purse
From a blind senior citizen
You know the wack shit like Bob Denver known as Gilligan, I'm killin' 'em
Facin' twenty-five to life if I touch a pen again
So I thought I might quit, but then I thought again
At least I'm dyin' for a cause instead of Benjamins, uhh


Now I rock velour jumpsuits, no shirt on
Tryin' to get my flirt on, throwin' hurt on the mic
Like white on rice, Platinum on ice. dots on dice
You may know some dope niggas and they may be polite but they not this nice
I got twice what they do
Imagine evertything they wrote and at the top a little two
He gon' have to spit a few if I only spit one
You mess with sixteen bars, I'm simply bar none, far from ordinary
Even by my fuckin' milk from the Legendary
Fairy dust M.C.s, time to get your wings clipped
When you're playin' Mr. Tough and you're sweet as Pixie Stix
Your fans, they suck it up, the truth must be exposed
I jump on stage and fuck em up
Jabroni's never stand a chance against rap entertainment's most electrifying man
Mics short circuit soon as they touch my hands
Sell my music on the streets to stay in touch with my fans
Man, my crew can't be beat!
We got this thing locked like the door on a white lady's automoblie
When she sees me cross the street
Flat out truth when I speak
With no time for plateaus I keep striving for the peak until I go insane
And it's as plain as the clothes on an undercover cop
That I got a fan base that'll never stop growing, been around for a while

I can't get there on my own
You can't leave me here alone
I’m just trying to do what’s right
Oh a man ain’t a man 'less he’s fought the fight

I could never point you out
Waste of space in a faceless crowd
Tell me what I have to say
If you know what’s right, then you’ll walk away

When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

One by one I've seen em fall
Some just don’t show up at all
I’m just here to fight the fire
Oh a man ain’t a man 'less he has desire

And the walls come down
And the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

You tore out my heart
And you threw it away
The western girl with eastern eyes
Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now there’s nothing in the way
In the way
In the way
In the way

When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

You tore out my heart
You threw it away
The western girl with eastern eyes
Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now there’s nothing in the way

Baby girl, don’t don't ask about me
I’m just bad girl, I’m bad for everybody
Babygirl, don't tell your friends
That nigga with a neck tat, respect that
Old bitch, she ain't like that, she left that
Dropped one tape, two tape
Brand new can't even get a hold off a nigga
Pose with a man that's like that
Smooth nigga does no-no rappin'
New girl, 5 stars​, she an actress
She's so used to the light, so plastic
By the lake, LA like Magic
Spit rappin', no plan, just glasses, a bad habit
Then I tell them, baby—

Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)

I don't wanna love, love

Yeah girl you know I’m too legit
Hittin' on my mans that I be coolin' with, hooligan
Girl I told you I ain't one you foolin' with
Not communicatin' but I get that from my mama
It's a jungle of gorillas—why you fuck with anacondas?
I'm a Zulu Nation rapper, get the hammer like your honor
Keep it movin' for my partners, ain't no hoovin' in mi casa
Ain't no hoopin', she just dancing at the juices but not Fanta
Got the juice and then I lost it
I put two in my deposit last week
But I made that cat weak, black sheep, ay
Do not fall in love with that nigga wrap sheet, ay
You know I'm just out here really tryna pass me, ay
Young Ciscero keep that ass nasty, ay
I don't know bout that but I do love
This right here, this that group love
Hey, so what happened to love?
This that, ""Time to shoot, get your new girl""

Puedo ponerme cursi y decir que tus labios
Me saben igual que los labios que beso en mis sueños
Puedo ponerme triste y decir que me basta
Con ser tu enemigo, tu todo, tu esclavo, tu fiebre, tu dueño
Y si quieres también puedo ser tu estación y tu tren
Tu mal y tu bien, tu pan y tu vino
Tu pecado, tu Dios, tu asesino...
O tal vez esa sombra
Que se tumba a tu lado en la alfombra
A la orilla de la chimenea
A esperar que suba la marea
Puedo ponerme humilde y decir que no soy el mejor
Que me falta valor para atarte a mi cama
Puedo ponerme digno y decir ""toma mi dirección
Cuando te hartes de amores baratos, de un rato me llamas""
Y si quieres también puedo ser tu trapecio y tu red
Tu adiós y tu ven, tu manta y tu frío
Tu resaca, tu lunes, tu hastío...
O tal vez ese viento
Que te arranca del aburrimiento
Y te deja abrazada a una duda
En mitad de la calle y desnuda
Y si quieres también, puedo ser tu abogado y tu juez
Tu miedo y tu fe, tu noche y tu día
Tu rencor, tu porque, tu agonía

Que se tumba a tu lado en la alfombra

Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang

I'm a fuckin' walkin' paradox — no, I'm not
Threesomes with a fuckin' triceratops, Reptar
Rappin' as I'm mockin' deaf rock stars
Wearin' synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks
Bedrock, harder than a motherfuckin' Flintstones
Making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones
This nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown
About five, seven of his bitches in my bedroom
Swallow the cinnamon, I'ma scribble this sin and shit
While Syd is tellin' me that she's been gettin' intimate with men
(Syd, shut the fuck up)
Here's the number to my therapist (Shit)
You tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'

Wolf Haley, Golf Wang
Wolf Haley, Golf fuckin' Wang

Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
I told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline
For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time
I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal
This the revenge of the dicks; that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?)
Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane at that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want – fuck money, diamonds, and bitches; don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave
Damn

Wolf Haley, Golf Wang
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah
Goddamn goblin
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah

They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again! Another critic writing report
I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork
Still suicidal, I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' goblin
(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit

We fight every night, now that's not kosher
I reminisce with bliss of when we was closer
And wake up to be greeted by an argument again
You act like you're ten
So immature, I try to concentrate on a cure
And keep lookin' at the front door
Thinkin' if I were to evacuate
You'd probably be straighter than straight
And wouldn't have so much hate
Cause you don't know the pain I feel when I see you smilin'
And when I roll up you start wilin'
So I front like everything's hunky-dory
But it's a whole different story
You don't like the fact that I'm me
I don't put on a show
When it comes time for you to have company
And your friends don't understand your choice of man
They speak proper while my speech is from a garbage can
But regardless, you shouldn't have to be so raw
I'm lookin' at the front door

I'm lookin' at the front door
Baby, I'm lookin' at the front door
I'm lookin' at the front door

And when you're with your friends, I glide to the side
Until the spotlight is mine and never sabotage a good time
But when they're not around, the fights commence
I'm the one you're against and it doesn't make sense
Cause I'm the one that you claim to love for life
But all I get is gray hairs and strife
And I can play some ole stuck-up rapper role
And get foul every time you lose control
But that's not my order of operations
So I should win an award for lots of patience
Cause that's all a fella can have
With a girl who's shootin' up his world like Shaft
And I don't think that I can take it anymore
I'm lookin' at the front door


My friends always tell me how I'm lucky to possess
The best looking girl in the whole U.S
But every time you scream, you blow your finesse
Tryin' to dis the Professor
Twenty-four hours of acting sore
Sometimes I wish you'd come down with lockjaw
So I don't have to take in the breakin'
You treat me like a burnt piece of bacon
It seems like just two years
Back when we were bonded and not pierced
But now I keep itchin' to jet
Sitting' in the chair just to stare, set to sprint
Yo, sweetheart, you better take a hint
I say it now like I said it before
I'm lookin' at the front door

아무런 이유 없이 생각이 나
그냥 조용히
아무런 예고 없이
혼자서 있을 때 난
네 생각이 나
습관처럼 네 소식을 확인하고
쓸데없이 핸드폰만 쳐다봐
너를 끊기 힘들었던 그때보단
숨 막히게 공허한 지금이 나아
I don’t miss you

그래도 아직 너를
못 참고 찾게 될까 불안해져
애써 아닌 척
무심한 척 해봐도
네 작은 흔적에도
무너져 난
술이 없인 고작 하루를 못 지내고
평생 안 펴봤던 담배를 배웠어

Oh take it slow 'cause I’m a lover not a fighter babe
I hold you in my heart if you keep me locked up like your enemy
And all of the signs point away but I stay
I’m yours tonight
No one understands, I don’t care when your lips are so pure and white

You’re all I ever ever wanted baby
My Elysian palace my Parisian chalice
And the lights will flicker
As the days go quicker
But these nights we spend will last forever
Forever baby

Don’t be so coy
You’ve got a lot to answer for my dear
The secret’s finally out
There’s nothing left to run away from here
Champagne every night
Every day is okay when you're king of France
Don’t wait for the change
When you've payed you've gotta take the money and run

You’re all I ever ever wanted baby

In the champagne drought I lost my mind
So I started smoking cigarettes with boxed wine
When I made a sound, my neighbors cried
Said all my songs sound just like drunken lullabies
Said I couldn't change, so I broke the mold
And I put my dreams in bottles knowing they would float
To a better place where I could be myself
Don't wanna be another blonde doll on the shelf

Every day all day
Every day all day
Ah-a, ah-a-ah-a
I hear choirs in my head
They won't stop until I'm dead
Ah-a, every day all day
Ah-a-ah-a, every day all day
I hear choirs in my head, in my head

And I like to think they're all my friends
When I fall apart they put me back together again
It's like they see and understand
Every day, all day, every day when
People show their teeth, don't bite your tongue
Baby, you're a diamond shining with no lights on
If it gives you peace, keep raising hell

Every day all day
Every day all day

Sometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch

But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
Faking sleep to count your breath

Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Is there nothing left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do

But when I'm sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair

I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And given all my love

Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do

Record this?!
You are no exception
There are no reruns
Justify your reasons
Now it is my turn
We are the wolves!

How’s it gonna feel when there’s no one to support ya?
How’s it gonna feel when you’re standing there alone?
You are no exception
There are no reruns
Justify your reasons
Now it is my turn

Your fits of paranoia
Drive your every whim
Well have you seen her?

This is the point we have the choice to be happy together

We have achieved so much more
Than you possibly thought we could
Love that you’re seething
You can achieve anything
Just remember, no ""I"" in team
There’s two in brilliant
We are the wolves of winter
We live in a kingdom of blood

When you gonna rise, seek a man you can dispose of?
When you gonna try to boil my last bone?
This is true obsession
Take me and my worth
Subtle as a steam burn
More than just a scald

You stink of hallelujah
But you wash yourself in sin
Well have you seen her?

In the summer
You said you loved me like an animal
Stayed beside me
Just enough to keep your belly full
Then you took me down to the water got your mouth all clean
Left me drowning once you picked me out your bloody teeth

Spent the autumn
In the forest hunting for a wolf
Tried to find you
Stopped my searching when the nights grew cold
Dreamt I saw you down by the water with your mouth still clean
You were searching - I came to you and you said to me
That I'm not –

Only what you wanted for a little while
Only what you wanted for a little while
Only what you wanted for a little while
Only what you wanted for a little while

Through the winter
I was shuttered in between my sheets
Checked the window
Just to see if you’d come back to me
The spring was coming, I saw you running down to the creek
A ring finger fell to the water from your bloody teeth
I guess I'm –

Ouh-oh
Baby

Me imagino tú y yo entre humo y botella'
Mientras voy tocándote y chupándote entera
Llevarte a un nivel lleno de extasís
Ella no quiere contigo, ella quiere con De La

Tú fuma', yo fumo, fumo to'a la noche
Llama a tu amiga pa' darle a las dos
Sé que quieres, sé que quiere hacerlo bien rico
Esta noche, esta noche tú va' ser mía
Tú fuma', yo fumo, fumo to'a la noche
Llama a tu amiga pa' darle a las dos
Sé que quieres, sé que quiere hacerlo bien rico
Esta noche, esta noche tú va' ser mía

Síguete moviendo encima de mí
No pares de hacerlo que me gusta así
Te pongo en cuatro, te pongo a gritar, te pongo rápido a decir
Que yo soy el único que te hace bien rico venir

El cuarto lleno de humo, lo que prendo es puro
La baby me dice: ""chulo, chingando tú eres el duro""
Entonces apenas comienzo, ucha vela e incienso
Me dice: ""que rico lo siento""
Que vuelva y lo saque y lo meta pa' adentro

Tú fuma', yo fumo, fumo to'a la noche
Llama a tu amiga pa' darle a las dos
Sé que quieres, sé que quiere hacerlo bien rico
Esta noche, esta noche tú va' ser mía
Tú fuma', yo fumo, fumo to'a la noche
Llama a tu amiga pa' darle a las dos
Sé que quieres, sé que quiere hacerlo bien rico
Esta noche, esta noche tú va' ser mía

Grandes son sus medidas, ella es sólo mía
Las amigas le tiran porque están to'as mordi'as
Está toda perfecta y a las demás les molesta
Conmigo no quiere cuenta, en su cuerpo invertí los cincuenta

Uhh, le gusta conmigo nada más
Hacerlo to'a la noche sin parar
Conmigo fuma y se arrebata
Sabe que como yo nadie la trata
Soy el que bien la maltrata dando y dando más

Me imagino tú y yo entre humo y botella'
Mientras voy tocándote y chupándote entera
Llevarte a un nivel lleno de extasís
Ella no quiere contigo, ella quiere con De La

Tú fuma', yo fumo, fumo to'a la noche
Llama a tu amiga pa' darle a las dos
Sé que quieres, sé que quiere hacerlo bien rico
Esta noche, esta noche tú va' ser mía
Tú fuma', yo fumo, fumo to'a la noche
Llama a tu amiga pa' darle a las dos
Sé que quieres, sé que quiere hacerlo bien rico

Let's act like it is
And just go crazy
Do what we want with no reason why
Life ain't long enough
So let's celebrate
And get drunk on good love
Remember what it's like to just dance all night

But, baby, we ain't doing nothing wrong
Gonna be up all night
Chasing the sunrise
Like we're wild and young
Baby, kids on the run
Gonna party like we just turned 21

Let's treat this town
Like we own it
And baby, if you wanna get out
You can drive this car like you stole it
Like we're runaways, like we're superstars
Like we're fireworks burning in the dark

Whatever happened to predictability?
The milkman, the paperboy, the evening tv?
How did I get delivered here? Somebody tell me please
Cause this old world is just really confusing me

Clouds as mean as you've ever seen
Ain't a bird that knows your tune
Then a little voice inside of you whispers
""Kid, don't sell your dreams so soon!""

Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you

Whatever happened to the good old days?
Talking to friends for hours, swore it'd never go away
Now I'm feeling a little crazy, trying to fit in with a scene
Cause how do you know where you're going, if you really don't know who you've been?

Everybody eventually
Says that they're as lost as you
So everybody shout it together
""Hey, don't sell your dreams so soon!""

Nobody you meet could ever see
The loneliness there
Inside you

Could it be you just don't try
Or is it the clothes you wear?
You're always window-shopping
But never stopping to buy
So, shed those dowdy feathers and fly

There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And, oh, what a change there'd be
The world would see

Yeh-eh-eh
Yeh-eh-eh
Eh-eh-eh
Yeh-eh-eh
Sé que sólo somo' amigo'
Una noche es lo que pido
Sé que quieres conmigo, yo quiero contigo
Quiero amanecer contigo

Beba
Tú y yo podemos ser más que amigos, amigo', eh
Deseo recorrer tu cuerpo
Y cada noche amanecer contigo, contigo, baby
Beba
Tú y yo podemos ser más que amigos, amigo', eh
Deseo recorrer tu cuerpo
Y cada noche amanecer contigo, contigo, baby
(El Wasón, bebé)

De pequeño' nos conocemo'
Yo conozco tus sentimientos
Tú sabes hasta cuando miento
Tú sabes cómo me siento
Conmigo tú la pasas bien
Yo sé cómo tú te ries, bebé
Con tu mirada yo me hipnoticé
Y con tu cuerpo yo me enamoré
Ayer cuando yo te busqué, un beso te robé
Se que te gusté, eh
No me lo niegues, bebé
Que con tus besos yo me juquié, eh eh

Tú quieres y yo quiero
Me enredé en tus beso'
Y contigo yo me quedo
(El Wasón, bebé)

Beba
Tú y yo podemos ser más que amigos, amigo', eh
Deseo recorrer tu cuerpo
Y cada noche amanecer contigo, contigo, baby
Beba
Tú y yo podemos ser más que amigos, amigo', eh
Deseo recorrer tu cuerpo
Y cada noche amanecer contigo, contigo, baby

El que juega con fuego se quema
Estar contigo es un problema
Estamos pecando sin penas
Somos como Adán y Eva
El que juega con fuego se quema
Estar contigo es un problema
Tenerte es un problema
Comerte es otro problema
No importa que seamos amigos (amigos)
Quiero amanecer contigo (contigo)
Hacemo' el amor sin testigo' (testigo')
Tranquila, que tú andas conmigo (conmigo)
Quiero que seas la reina de mi castillo
Subirte al altar, entregarte el anillo
Cuando tengas frío yo seré tu abrigo
No importa que seamos mejores amigos

Tú quieres y yo quiero
Me enredé en tus beso'
Y contigo yo me quedo

Beba
Tú y yo podemos ser más que amigos, amigo', eh
Deseo recorrer tu cuerpo
Y cada noche amanecer contigo, contigo, baby
Beba
Tú y yo podemos ser más que amigos, amigo', eh

It's not difficult
For me to say I love you
It wouldn't be difficult
If you would say the same
And believe me when I tell you
That I know you very well
I know you like I know my name
I think that I have met you
Somewhere in my dreams
I may never have met you at all
And I know you must be thinking
""What a silly girl""
I know your every thought and scheme
I wake up to the feeling each morning
I go to bed to it at night
I know you, I live you
Like I feel the sun in the morning
Like I see the moon at night
I know you as if I've known you all my life
I know you, I live you
One day you'll realize
We're not strangers
You'll open up your eyes
And know me too
And you'll see that we were
Meant to be together, my dear
And now the rest is up to you
I wake up to the feeling each morning
Go to bed to it at night
I know you, I know you
Like I feel the sun in the morning
Like I see the moon at night
I feel you as if you were a part of me
I know you, I know you
Like I feel a sun in the morning
Like I see the moon at night
I think I know you more than you know yourself
I know you, I live you
Know you, live you
Know you, live you
Know you, know you, know you
And without me you'd stumble
And without you I'd fall
Without each other we would not be at all
(Whoa)
Like I feel the sun in the morning
Like I see the moon at night
Like I feel the sun in the morning
(I know you)
Like I see the moon at night
(I live you)
Like I feel the sun in the morning

I'm trying to keep my feelings close
But I miss you I suppose
It's from my fingers to our toes
There are secrets no one knows
It's just a disguise, a little white lie
Digging a hole to find out

Who am I behind your eyes?

Love, don't let me go
If you feel the glow, out from the cold
If you love me tell me so (Oh)

I double dare to say it first
The only thing we've never heard
I knew it from the day I met you
I'd hang on all your every word
I may not have much, but I have enough
So when you're alone do I cross your mind?
'Cause you're always in mine

Oh love, don't let me go
If you feel the glow, out from the cold
If you love me tell me so
There's a world outside that's waiting for you, oh
But no one can make your mind up for you

So who am I behind your eyes?

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, ""Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?""
I should've said, ""No, someone's waiting for me""
But I called my girl up and said

""Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me""
""Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!""

Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

""Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me""
""Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!""

Listen baby I'm sorry (hello?)
Listen baby I'm sorry (hello?)
Gotta go
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery

Sometimes the river flows but nothing breathes
A train arrives but never leaves
It's a shame
Oh life
Like love that walks out of the door
Of being rich or being poor
Such a shame
But it's then, then that faith arrives
To make you feel at least alive
And that's why you should keep on aiming high
Just seek yourself and you will shine
You've got to search for the hero inside yourself
Search for the secrets you hide
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life
In this life, long and hard though it may seem
Live it as you'd live a dream
Aim so high
Just keep the flame of truth burning bright
The missing treasure you must find
Because you and only you alone
Can build a bridge across the stream
Weave your spell in life's rich tapestry
Your passport to a feel supreme
You've got to search for the hero inside yourself
Search for the secrets you hide
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life
You've got to search (search inside yourself)

Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel
He looks out a window without glass
The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
His father beats him cause he's too tired to beg
He's got 9 brothers and sisters
They're brought up on their knees
It's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
But that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard
He's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
He's going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, to the dirty boulevard
This room cost 2,000 dollars a month
You can believe it man it's true
Somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
No one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
They dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard
Give me your hungry, your tired your poor I'll piss on 'em
That's what the Statue of Bigotry says
Your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death
And get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard
Get 'em out, on the dirty boulevard
Going out, to the dirty boulevard
They're going down, on the dirty boulevard
Going out
Outside it's a bright night
There's an opera at Lincoln Center
Movie stars arrive by limousine
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
But the lights are out on the Mean Streets
A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
He's selling plastic roses for a buck
The traffic's backed up to 39th street
The TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck
And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
He's found a book on magic in a garbage can
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
""At the count of 3"" he says, ""I hope I can disappear""
And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly away

And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy won't you look down over me
Yeah I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered around his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for The King
Down in the Jungle Room

They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green will be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis

Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
And she said

We are the pirates that hide on the island invade or we wilding
Marauding and murdering merchantmen
We have been cursed by the curs
We shooting first on our turf
Pay us our proper respect
You pray for your God to end the perverse
He sent the worst of the worst
Every death demon disperse
We put them all in a hearse
We put them under the earth
We are the savages ravaging hell
Death in the air, we relish the smell
We are the hand of the Lord
We are the hand with the sword
Taking the heads of the faith
We are the sealers of fate
We are the fangs of the snake

Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

The enemies of the state
Pardon me, your mistake
See, I'm raised to eat pain
Appetite for sliced face
Me and Mike mount the Hellcat
Armed to the pearl-whites like yikes!
Twenty cents gets your ghost ejected
It's free now, go to the light
Me and Mike bring D'Lite to the knife fight
Get twenty-nine grand sliced
Me, I just take it light
Might light twenty-nine grand up in a night
Tongue lash slash in defiance
Born to brawl boy, the bastard alliance
Hardy-harr, you a laugh, I'm a riot
That's not a brag, that's SCIENCE!

Back from the bellows of hell
Back from the back of a jail in the cell
Back from the gun and the priest to the con and the creed
Back to the streets from the East
Back to the belly of beast
Back to the place of my peace
Back to me holding my piece
Anything working disturbing that peace
Will certainly meet the deceased, capiche?
Oh, why must I tell 'em again?
What must I tell 'em, my friend?
That we are born into sin
And we are worshiping murderers
Nothing but evil duplicitous men
I know you heard of 'em all
We should just murder 'em all
We should just murder and ball
We dance on the ruins we looting from all of they palace's walls

Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Let's go!

Don’t walk away I’m falling down
Don’t walk away I’m falling down
깊어져만 가는
밤하늘 별빛은 여전히
그 자리 그대를 기다리죠
한참을 말하지 않아도
그대 두 눈 들여다보면
나는 알아요 그대를 느끼죠

그대의 별 되어 늘 그대를 지킬게요

하루하루 같은 이곳에 남겨져
나 그대에게 머물게요

My love
Goodbye

그곳은 편하니
아직 날 찾아 헤매고
있는 건 아닌지
네가 내 품에 체온 전해 준
그 순간부터
세상 다 가진 것보다
가슴 벅차곤 했어
새벽 해가 뜰 만큼 긴 스케줄
피곤하게 집에 온 날 반겨준
넌 말이 아닌 눈빛만으로
나와 긴 대화를 해
이렇게 같이 사랑하며 지내자 우리
마지막 인사하는 날
아픈 몸으로 잠이 든
날 기다린 너
눈이 마주쳤지만
넌 가냘프게 울었고
그대로 움직이지 않아
나도 결국 울었어
더 사랑해주지 못한 미안함 맘에
매일 밤 눈물이 마를 생각을 않네
여전히 널 그리며 노래해줄게
내 가족 내 천사 내 사랑 good night

떠나지 마 날 떠나지 마
아직도 난 눈물에 지쳐가
가지 마 가지 마
더 작아져 더 작아져
널 떠올릴수록
눈물이 뚝뚝뚝뚝
눈물이 뚝뚝뚝뚝
돌아와 돌아와
불러도 올 수 없는 걸 알면서

네가 날 떠났어 꿈인지
내 볼을 또 꼬집어 봤어
눈물이 난 게 볼이 아파선지
네가 없어선진
몰라도 눈물을 참느라 혼났어
네가 없는 나를 상상해 본 적이
없어서 일상
모든 일들이 도전이
됐지 난 전혀 준비가 되지 않아서
다 포기할 걸 겨우 참았어
참았어, yeah
내가 참긴 뭘 참아
매일 밤 널 담지 못한
눈을 못 감아
Imma just die, I’ma die without you
담아선 안 될 말을
입에 담아 아마도
며칠이 지나고 시간이
약이 돼버리는 게 더 무서울 거 같아
시간이 멈추고 차라리 평생
이렇게 아픈 게 나을 거 같아

가끔 웃고 있어도
문득 네 얼굴 떠올라 girl

웃고 있는 데도 눈물이 나
나 진짜 정말 괜찮은데
자꾸 우울이 날
고이 접어놨던 내 맘을 흔들어
또 다시 떠올리게 해
너와의 시간들을
울지 않는다고 다짐했었는데
널 분명 잊었다고 생각했었는데
아닌가봐 난 네가 아님
더 이상 안 되나봐
제발 돌아와 나 여기 있을게

슬픈 기억이 됐고

My friends are so depressed
I feel the question
Of your loneliness
Confide, cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will

Ex-girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate
On the prison phone
They want to give her 7 years
For being sad

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

My friends are so distressed
And standing on
The brink of emptiness
No words I know of to express
This emptiness

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

Imagine me, taught by tragedy
Release is peace

I heard a little girl
And what she said
Was something beautiful
To give your love
No matter what
And what she said

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold

Missing you felt like pulling teeth
I taste the metal when you're next to me
It's so cold and sweet
It makes me wanna take it back
To the night when your car died
Kissing in the rain on a summer night
It was warm and sweet
It makes me wanna take it back
Kissing you felt like a lack of strength
The touch of your lips made my legs go weak
It was warm and sweet
It made me wanna take it back
To the night when it all began
I thought that fun was what I wanted then
Something cold but sweet
I wish that I could get that back
Wish that I could feel like that
Wish that I could get it
But remember what it felt like
When you told me it was the last time
I'd be seeing you
Missing you felt like I lack of rain
But I could be drowning if you'd say my name
It be warm and sweet
It'd make me wanna take it back
To the night when we last hung out
I knew that love was what I wanted now
But I got cold feet
I wish that I could take that back
Wish that I could take you back
Wish that I could take it
To the night where I first met you
I remember just how I left you
With I'd be seeing you
But remember what it felt like
When you told me it was the last time
I'd be seeing you

Ladies and gentlemen
Essa mina gosta de tocar o terror
Cê acredita? Quem diria, hein?

Essa mina é sem vergonha, gosta de tocar o terror
Já me deu até insônia, meu sossego acabou
Pesadelo da invejosa, sonho de quem não provou

Quando ela desce é igual terremoto
Ela senta e não para, ela toca o terror
Quando ela desce é igual terremoto
Ela senta e não para, toca o terror
Quando eu desço é igual terremoto
Rebolo, eu não paro, toco o terror
Quando eu desço é igual terremoto
Rebolo, eu não paro, toco o terror

Atrevida, poderosa, gosto de tocar o terror
Pra te ver perdendo a linha, teu sossego acabou
Pesadelo da invejosa, teu desejo eu sei que eu sou

Quando eu desço é igual terremoto
Rebolo, eu não paro, toco o terror
Quando eu desço é igual terremoto
Rebolo, eu não paro, toco o terror
Quando ela desce é igual terremoto
Ela senta e não para, ela toca o terror
Quando ela desce é igual terremoto
Ela senta e não para

E ela entrou na minha mente de um jeito indecente
Não como mais, não durmo mais, eu vou ficar doente
Tá querendo de novo, já caiu no meu jogo
Não pode se queimar, então, pra que brincar com fogo?
Mas eu sou artilheiro e eu vou virar o jogo
Eu vou partir pra cima, de virada é mais gostoso
Eu ganho essa parada, pode ficar ligada
Vai ver que eu sou zica, haha, cê acredita?

Quando eu desço é igual terremoto
Rebolo, eu não paro, toco o terror
Quando ela desce é igual terremoto
Ela senta e não para, ela toca o terror

Eu desço, não paro, rebolo, eu toco o terror
E ela desce, não para, rebola, toca o terror
Eu desço, não paro, rebolo, eu toco o terror
E ela desce, não para, rebola, toca o terror

Quando você rebola, é tipo como? É tipo terremoto

Historia nuestra, caballero
Y dice asi:

Las calles de Cartagena, aquella historia vivio
Cuando alli llegaban esos negreros, africanos en cadenas
Besaban mi tierra, esclavitud perpetua
Esclavitud perpetua

Que lo diga salome y que te de llego, llego, llego
Un matrimonio africano, esclavos de
Un espanol, el les daba muy mal trato

Venganza por su amor y aun se escucha

Gotas de lluvia, no es el rocío
Lagrimas que vienen del corazón
Gotas de lluvia, no es el rocío
Lagrimas que brotan porque ya no hay amor

Pudiste haberme dicho que no
Que no sentías nada por mí
Que lo nuestro nunca fue algo especial
La vida cambia y todo tiene final

Una aventura fuí para tí
Y fácilmente yo en tus redes caí
Un trago amargo que de tí recibí
Ahora no sé, no sé qué será de mí

Gotas de lluvia no es el rocío
Lagrimas que vienen del corazón
Gotas de lluvia, no es el rocío
Lagrimas que brotan porque ya no hay amor

Quisiera saber, saber porqué se escapó
De mis brazos toda la felicidad
A toda máquina corriendo voló
No dejó huella, se desapareció

No le importó que yo sintiera temor
De verme solo así llorando de amor
Y por su mente pienso que no pasó
Que por su culpa yo sintiera dolor

Gotas de lluvia no es el rocío
Lagrimas que vienen del corazón
Gotas de lluvia, no es el rocío
Lagrimas que brotan porque ya no hay amor

Verano azul que me calentó
Otoño gris que con el frío llegó
Verano azul que me calentó
Otoño gris que con el frío llegó

Poco a poco me fuí quedando sin respiración
Sin una explicación, ey, ey, ey, eh
Mucho te quise, tal vez el mundo me quedó al revés
Ya no quiero vivir, sin tí para qué existir

Verano azul que me calentó
Otoño gris que con el frío llegó
Verano azul que me calentó
Otoño gris que con el frío llegó


Gotas de lluvia
Dame valor, que yo quiero saber la forma
De olvidar tu amor

Es desilusión

Caminando por la playa, me encontré con una chica
Ella me dijo hola nene, yo le dije hola chiquita
Que tal si nos conocemos, y animamos el ambiente
Nos tomamos una cerveza, porque esto está caliente

Ella se quitó la ropa, yo miré su cuerpo
Nos metimos en el agua y pasamos el tiempo
Formamos una locura, prendido de su cintura
Y nos fuimos mar adentro, donde nos llevará el viento

Y ella me besó,oh oh oh

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

Tar on the road held the heat of the day
Craving the danger as on it we lay
Clothes like cling-fim on your back
Caught in the swelter like it's a trap
Dizzier then we're spiraling down
Our time is all spent cause I'm spending it now
Tar on the road held the heat of day
You're holding it in you say you're okay

And I believe you
Cause nothing else could get much better
I believe you
Feeling like we're at the equator
I see you
Keeping to yourself

Stepping right in to find out we were blind
Our vision was drowned by a burning sky
Caught in the daze you wore so well
The hotter it got the less that I felt
Treading the line of the land in the sea
Shivering as we got up to our knees
It's colder than we thought it'd be
Further south than we'd ever been

But I need you
It's hard to make you not forget
That we need you
After all this time I'm starting to see you
Convince me that you're fine

I can see your collarbones and baby I'm scared
Never thought I'd be so unprepared

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Hold your horses
Hold, hold the border
Don't come closer
Don't, don't let go of me
I'm like porcelain
When you're with me
All, all I know is

Just about a million ways to harm you
All the things I shouldn't say
Are the things that when I want to make you happy
Only comes out of me

What if I dropped, dropped the steering wheel
Closed my eyes
Drove, drove faster
I'm like porcelain
When I love you
I, I know it's

Just about a million ways to harm you
All the things I shouldn't say
Are the things that when I want to make you happy
Only comes out of me
We have got the power of destruction
You can always let it fall
But when we try to work on something solid
It is too goddamn hard

Give it a thought, it takes a lot
To trust that someone else will catch my fall (I'm like porcelain)
It takes a lifetime, breaking goes fast
When everything that matters made of glass

Just about a million ways to harm you
All the things I shouldn't say
Are the things that when I want to make you happy

Two step in the cut
Spotlights in the cut
Chances are you never saw
What made you who you are
So take a bow cause it's done
Your awful dreams are gone
And scars remain of running away
And hiding 'fore they come

See you want a place that's still
Place to cure your ills
A place to save your face
And keep you calm when you're uphill
You'll never be the best
She'll never turn you on
And scars remain from running away
And hiding where you're from

Don't lose my name
It makes me wonder
Will I ever be enough?
Don't call again
I couldn't answer
My deviation sets it off

Choosing what you live for
It's never what you make your life
How could you know
If you're squandering your passion for another?
Do you ever think, boy?
Or does it just feel better alone?
Feeling the comfort of sadness in a new set of surroundings

Swiping them gold cards

I got it made, gonna top the charts
Be the Hollywood sign, be a big star
Legacy, on the boulevard
Take another picture, give a little more
No stress just gotta make myself
Be a best seller waiting on a shelf
I say it'll be worth it when I can do it my way every day

Just wanna call out the haters
On a Kanye basis with fierceness

All the pain, hidden between thrills
Feelin' so busy I forget how I feel
We can take it slow, just post another photo
We'll be raking in the likes like it makes us feel alright, right?

Hashtagging blessings on blessings
And only stressing 'bout filters, hey
Hash bragging endless vacations
And quote inspirations
I thought I was me but I'm just combinations
'Cause who wants to be themselves

A life on every face

I would not expect you felt alone in standing north
Better to rise above the clouds
Then be a stranger in the crowd
All that you protected doesn’t matter anymore
Rather be stripped of all your pride
Than watch your dreams be cast aside

You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying stardom
Singing your own praise

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You are not content with being nameless and unknown
Trying to rise above the fray
Eager to give it all away
Some will not admit that 15 minutes have expired
Too much attention much too soon
Don’t see you walking on the moon

You are caught up in your gravity
Bathing in the spotlight
Imitating fame

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass


You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying madness
Singing your own praise

You live without shame

I'll stand for nothing less
Or never stand again
These are the limits when one's buried
This body's left the soul

Could we have known?
Never would I, helped to nail down

Careful of drifting off
Now losing taste and touch
Turning a pale blue, leaning in to say
This body's left the soul
The brain needs oxygen
Can't sneak around this bait
His catacomb has got me by the chin
This body's left the soul

Who's the lovin' daddy with the beautiful eyes
What a pair o' lips, I'd like to try 'em for size
I'll just tell him, ""Baby, won't you swing it with me""
Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
So, I said politely ""Darlin' may I intrude""
He said ""Don't keep me waitin' when I'm in the mood""
First I held him lightly and we started to dance
Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance
And I said ""Hey, baby, it's a quarter to three
There's a mess of moonlight, won't-cha share it with me""
""Well"" he answered ""Baby, don't-cha know that it's rude
To keep my two lips waitin' when they're in the mood""
In the mood, that's what he told me
In the mood, and when he told me
In the mood, my heart was skippin'
It didn't take me long to say ""I'm in the mood now""
In the mood for all his kissin'
In the mood his crazy lovin'
In the mood what I was missin'
It didn't take me long to say ""I'm in the mood now""

Hoy te vuelvo a besar a escondidas
Nuevamente las horas medidas
Ha pasado no sé cuanto tiempo
Desde aquel nuestro último encuentro
Como el aire que toca tu pelo
Como lluvia que dejas caer
Así soy para ti en los momentos
Que deseo volverte a tener
Bridge:
Y me siento un juguete en tus brazos
Que al mirarte pierdo la razón
Y me vuelvo a enredar en tu cuerpo
Y me ahogo en el mar de tu amor
Coro:
Siempre seré - Quien te calma tus deseos de amar
Pero nunca llegaré a imaginar
Lo profundo de tu alma, de tu corazón
Siempre seré - La ternura que despierta pasión
Sin llegar a ser jamás la ilusión
Ese amor fascinante que te enamoré

Como lluvia que dejas caer
Así soy para ti en los momentos

Siempre Seré - Mira quien te calma tus deseos de amar, ese soy yo...
Siempre - Como la lluvia, que moja tu pelo
Siempre Seré - Pero que siempre, siempre, seré tu consuelo
Siempre - Y por las noches si no estás conmigo, yo me desvelo
Siempre Seré - Tú para mi, yo para ti - Por siempre en la vida
Siempre - Yo soy el hombre, que no te olvida
Doo Doo Doo Doo, Doo Doo Doo Doo
Siempre Seré - Que tu serás para mi y yo seré para ti
Siempre - Yo no te puedo borrar de mi mente, pues te tengo presente
Siempre Seré - Soy lo profundo de tu alma y de tu corazón
Siempre - El que te quiere, el que te mima, el que te ama soy yo
Siempre Seré - Tú me perdonas como siempre, cuando no te doy amor
Siempre - Soy el que te da, y te da, te da, te da, te da calor

I feel it, it's coming

Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

When you looked into my eyes
And you said goodbye could you see my tears
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
Till I feel your

Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say, never go away


Waiting is the hardest thing
It's strange

I tell myself that if I believe in you
I feel like I've known you before

In the dream of you
And I want to understand you

With all my heart and all my soul
More and more and more

That by sheer force of will
When I'm with you

I will raise you from the ground
I feel like a magical child

And without a sound, you'll appear
Everything strange

And surrender to me, to love
Everything wild

Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain
I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like

Kitty Malone sat on a mule
Was riding in style
When suddenly, like the sound of a buzzard’s breaking
Kitty felt laser beams being fired at her head
She said, ""I hate laser beams
And you never done see me askin’
For a UFO
In Tomahawk County""
Well she kicked the mule
And it walked the path
And the aliens fired from behind
Till she stopped the mule
And she kicked the rump
And the big old mule took a big old dump

Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
Take your laser beams away
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
You better stop that laser game

Or you’ll smell my mule
She felt the fire against her neck
And it saddened her to feel it burn
When suddenly, like the sound of a breeding Holstein
Kitty said, ""Stop, we ain’t lookin’ for fightin’
In Tomahawk County.""
A little guy from the UFO
Came on out and said his name was Joe
She said, ""Come on over for some lemonade
Just follow me now with the whole brigade""
Scent of a mule…
They walked into her cabin shack
They had never seen a southern home
And they liked it, better than their UFO
They liked it, they really liked it
They said, ""Here’s a place of elegance
Here we shower ourselves in lightness""

I had to turn my heart away
Smile like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails!

I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now won't you, Barracuda?


Back over time, we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me
No right, no wrong, you're selling a song, a name
Whisper game

And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn burn to the wick
Ooh, Barracuda

""Sell me sell you"" the porpoise said
Dive down deep to save my head
I think that you got the blues, too
All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools!

I can't believe it's been all these years
I can't believe I've cried all these tears
My friends tell me I should've moved on
A long long time ago
But what do they know?
What do they know?

And I don't mean to be selfish
But my heart breaks every time
That I see you smile
'Cause I know that it's not me
Who brings it out of you anymore
You found somebody new
You put me in the past
I don't even know if our memories will last
But if by chance it doesn't work out with her
You'll always have a chance with me in my world

I wonder what happens when you hear our song
Do you brush it away or do you sing along?
Do you talk about the future the way we did?
Is there room for me in it?
Is there room for me in it?

And I don't mean to be selfish
But my heart breaks every time

But if by chance it doesn't work out with her
You'll always have a chance with me in my world

Is it so wrong of me to hope she breaks your heart?
Is it so wrong of me to pray she tears you apart?
And I know that in the darkest part of you
You pray and hope and wish for it too

Cause you don't mean to be selfish
But your heart breaks every time
That you see me smile
Cause you know that it's not you
Who brings it out of me anymore

I hope you find a little more time
Remember we were partners in crime
It's only two years ago
The man with the suit and the face
You knew that he was there on the case
Now he's in love with you
He's in love with you
And love is like a high prison wall

When we loose our winter coats in the spring

We scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
And just like every ferris wheel stops turning
I guess we had an expiration date
So I won't say I love you, it's too late

Shivering and shaking at the knees
And just like every song I haven't heard yet no

All alone, staring on
Watching her life go by
When her days are grey and her nights are black
Different shades of mundane
And the one-eyed furry toy that lies upon the bed
Has often heard her cry
And heard her whisper out a name long forgiven
But not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're not forgotten
A bleeding heart torn apart
Left on an icy grave
In their room where they once lay face to face
And nothing could get in the way
But now the memories of a man are haunting her days
And the craving never fades
She's still dreaming of a man long forgiven
But not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're not forgotten
Still alone, staring on
Wishing her life goodbye
As she goes searching for the man long forgiven

Como la arena sin mar, como el café sin pan

Con una botella y yo dedicándote ""Bella"" (Mujer tan bella)

For two hearts that bleed with burning love

Shot my love at fifteen paces

And then I fall to the floor like my strings are cut
Spit in the wind but I don't wake up
Pinch myself cause too much is not enough

We've been here before, surrounded in the cold
You take me to places I've never known
And you push me to places I'll never go
I would die for you
Tell me the truth
Am I all that you would need?
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you

But you got me shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

I've been through it whole
I've been through the worst
But I never knew how much our love could hurt
Over my family I put you first
Writing out my feelings is the only thing that work
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too
But I hold on to the poems I would write you
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku
[Chorus 2
You got me shot down by love
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

She calls me from the cold
Just when I was low
Feeling short of stable
All that she intends
And all she keeps inside
Isn't on the label
She says she's ashamed
Can she take me for a while?
Can I be a friend?
We'll forget the past
Or maybe I'm not able
And I break at the bend
We're here and now
Will we ever be again?
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
Away again
She dreams a champagne dream
Strawberry surprise
Pink linen on white paper
Lavender and cream
Fields of butterflies
Reality escapes her
She says that love
Is for fools that fall behind
And I'm somewhere between
I never really know
A killer from a savior
'Til I break at the bend
We're here and now
Will we ever be again?

Pick it up
This'll get you out of your head
China's hanging out by the railings
Of the motorshed
She goes with a real hit biker
He's a metalhead
She looks me up and down
Talking dirty eyes
Sweet saying boy baby
I could lick ya any time
Keep it up
That's right...here we go again
Bit later I'm going to run
Into her round the back
While other guys break heads
In the Sugar Shack
Don't give me drink I don't want to
Get too stoned
Then we're going to see who's going to
Take who home

The violence of summer
A love's taking over
It starts with desire
Ends up under cover

Those lips will make me rise
You may look down but don't think twice
Slow death is on the way
So what man I still want to play
One, two
This'll get you out of your mind
This'll get you up...let's go
Maybe take a ride going south
Where her mother writes
Before bad news catches up
We still got a little time
We'll leave it all so far away
One thing is sure we shouldn't stay
I take it all little Chine going to
Get the runaround a run... a runaround


China... na china...nanana

I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore
Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fighting for
When I say out loud
""I want to get out of this""
I wonder is there anything
I'm going to miss

I wonder how it's going to be
When you don't know me
How's it going to be
When you're sure I'm not there
How's it going to be
When there's no one there to talk to
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be

Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the
Doorway we spent time in, swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me

I wonder how's it going to be
When it goes down
How's it going to be
When you're not around
How's it going to be

Meet me in outer space

Watch the earth come up
I've grown tired of that place

What happened to me?
Felt like I had everything
Such a big catastrophe, but I had to deal with the struggle
It all began passing life so easily
Ready for almost anything, but it took a different direction
Then, one night, sharp turns
A light came from nowhere
Blown away
Never felt my injuries
Bleeding deep inside of me
Just knew I had to help all those people
Lost
My mind
It's gone
That life
Lost
I've been looking for myself
It haunts me everyday
I'm searching for a truth no longer there
Transformed I'm someone else
Must face my phantom self
Transformed I'm someone else
Must face my phantom self
It's a mystery
Changed my body's chemistry
Always creeping up on me
Wiped out my whole soul of existence
The crash
Flashbacks
Carnage
The blood keeps on flowing
Killing me
Trapped inside this tragedy
Can't see the road in front of me
Replay this nightmare over and over
Lost
I've been looking for myself
It haunts me everyday
I'm searching for a truth no longer there
Transformed I'm someone else
Must face my phantom self
Transformed I'm someone else
I'll face my phantom self

Somewhere out where no one knows
Runs a cool evolution fight
Way out there where no one goes
And it's got to keep moving
Got to keep getting it right
Sphere's to the piston charged
Ombustable delight
The single minded supercharged
That' got to get moving
Got to keep getting it right

A call right through the dream
A call to action

Mean green killing machine
The clock, your only friend
As time leaves it's debris
Your soul is on the mend
But time is killing me
I gave you everything
But a machine
I'll always be
They got nothing more to add to the conversation
They drink gasoline from a dirty glass
They got nothing but a sad–sad situation
With nothing more to ad to the damnation
Nuts & bolts & screws with no social class
They got nothing but a sad–sad situation
It's a sad, sad, sad situation
Nuts & bolts & screws, balls of brass
If you're out where no one goes
Where no one cares to lie
Keep 'em open don't you blink
I'm talking 'bout, talking 'bout your eyes
It's faster than the speed of light
And sonically disguised
There comes the mean green motherfucker blazing 'cross the sky
A call to arms
A call right through the dream
A call to action
Blow up the in between
Feed, feed your engine
Feed, feed your Wolverine
Feed, feed the tension

I am a sinner and I worship evil
Blood is thinner but you will never know
Can you confess that you thrive in chaos?
You're a sorceress and your eye is on the lost
But you're dying
It's in your eyes
You're a charlatan, you get everything you wish
You're a harlot, carry poison in your kiss
Beg forgiveness with a dagger in your hand
Sow your death seed and reap the dying lands
But you're crying
It's only vice
Empty vessel
Drained of hope
And none the lesser at the end of
A rope
Have you ever hated like I?
Know I still awaited the absence of lies
Watch your eager tongue
Attack me from behind
Riddle whispers, bleak futile control
Like a twin sister adapting to a role
You're a murderer, bloodlust increase
You're a harvester, come close to spread disease
And you're hiding
I hear you cry

Meant to say public, it must be the crush

Anybody that knows me, if you've ever been around me
Or ever had the opportunity to be blessed to be in my presence
I'm upright, independent, and fearless at all times
I don't engage in no bullshit
I mean, unless it's with my lil' team
You know, other than that, you know
All relationships are circumstantial to me

Jump in the dashboard, I'm thuggin', I'm playin Rover
I still was sufferin' internally whenever you came over
You told me whatever decision I make that we would remain closer
But you kinda changed over, just try to remain sober
Kick dirt on my name, I maintain, then I stay focused
They get on Instagram and take shots at me, thinkin' I ain't noticed
I got a thing on top my neck, it got a brain on it (It do)
I got a thing inside my chest, it got some stains on it (I do)
I hit the shower, go work out, and I don't think on it
You draw your sword, get met with force, you can bank on it
I'm Uptown in a Porsche, got my name on it
On South 12th, but of course, got my name on it
On Carolina and on Alice, got my name on it
Go ask Lil Derrick on Saint Joseph, got my name on it
Pressure on my end, now it's time to wild out
We don't do no drive-bys, we spin through and we hop out

Whether for worse or better
Time’s been working against us since forever
It could really work if we work together
But what happens when one wants too much
Do we let it go or

Do we give it another try
Or finally find the good in a goodbye
Maybe right one, but wrong time, but it’s cool
Either way it goes, we’re never in control because

We try to decide in our minds who’s right
Heaven only knows
We like to tell ourselves little lies to get by
Heaven only knows
We don’t even know if whether things’ll ever get better
Or not, we tried so why not move on with your life
Don’t make no sense wasting your time
Heaven only knows

Yeah, I know it hurts but it gets better
Try to ride out the storm and weather the weather
Why settle for less than you want?
You can’t ignore you need more than smoke and mirrors
You’ll get what you deserve (What you deserve)
When you know just how much you’re worth
Nothing less than someone who will put you first
Either way it goes, you’re never in control because

We try to decide in our minds who’s right

We like to tell ourselves little lies to get by
Heaven only knows
We don’t even know if whether things’ll ever get better
Or not, we tried so why not move on with your life
Don’t make no sense wasting your time

Heaven only know (Heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows
Thought you had somebody (But it didn’t work)
When you play with love (Sometimes it hurts)
You’re thinking life is over (But it could be worse)
When it’s really up to the stars (And the universe)
In the meantime, don’t be sittin’ around feeling sorry for yourself
(Need to let it go)
‘Cause right now might be the right time to love somebody else
(Heaven only knows)
It’s not up to you, you don’t get to choose
Love has its own rules, just let it come to you

'Cause we try to decide in our minds who’s right

I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore
Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fighting for
When I say out loud
""I want to get out of this""
I wonder is there anything
I'm going to miss

I wonder how it's going to be
When you don't know me
How's it going to be
When you're sure I'm not there
How's it going to be
When there's no one there to talk to
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be

Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the
Doorway we spent time in, swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me

I wonder how's it going to be
When it goes down
How's it going to be
When you're not around
How's it going to be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me
Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be

And how's it going to be

And how's it going to be

Closed eyes open wide
Do you get the message I'm tryna send to you
I'm not one to waste time
So baby let our mind set vibes split in two
I don't wanna talk
I just wanna lay in silence in your arms
I don't wanna play it safe, no
I just wanna break every rule like criminals
Savage individuals

So let's give into our temptations
Every minute with you
Let's exceed our expectations
Every moment with you
I need passion like fire (fire) fire (fire)
Leave it smokin', leave it smokin'
I need passion like fire (fire) fire (fire)
Leave it smokin', leave it smokin'

Maybe we need a shot we can chase with lime
Whatever it takes to unwind
I wanna make you leave your comfort zone
Take everything off, put my body on you

Let's give into our temptations
Every minute with you
Let's exceed our expectations
Every moment with you
I need passion like fire (fire) fire (fire)
Leave it smokin', leave it smokin'
I need passion like fire (fire) fire (fire)
Leave it smokin', leave it smokin'

I'm on the way out, I'm on the way out
I want you out of my comfort zone
I'm on the way out, I'm on the way out
I want you out of your comfort zone

I want you out of my comfort zone
I'm on the way out, I'm on the way out
I want you out of your comfort zone
I'm on the way out, I'm on the way out

How many times have you heard someone say
If I had money, I would do things my way
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Money can't buy back all your youth when you're old
A friend, when you're lonely, or peace to your soul
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When my life is over and my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones, I will leave, there's no doubt
But, one thing's for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
One thing's for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

Es fácil decir ""te voy a extrañar.""
Se siente morir, no puedo engañar
A un corazón, que supo amar
Con otra razón, aparte de dar
No siento tu voz, no escucho tu hablar
Presiento que dos es un número impar
No puedo seguir sin tu respirar
Entiende que yo sólo quiero llegar
CORO:
No puedo volar si no están tus pasos
Que llenen el tiempo de ti
No quiero volar
Sin que extiendas tus brazos
Y sientas la brisa en tu rostro
Y te mojes de mí

La calle de las sirenas (x4)
Atraviesan unicornios que son blancos y que brincan sin parar
Hacia el lado mas angosto de la calle
Si te fijas bien arriba, del letrero, de zapatos hayaras
Unas hadas trabajando en un vestido azul
Parece que solo levantan la (mirada)
Cuando los duendes pasan (pasan)
Hacia el castillo al final de la calle
Es justo ahí donde hace mas calor
Oohuuhoo
Imaginate a las sirenas en la luna
Oohuuhoo
Empapando a las estrellas con pintura
Y princesas pasan bailando con vestidos que van volando
En un carruaje azul
El dragon de ese castillo esta triste y tiene muy mal humor
Es su fuego enloquecido lo que da calor
Y la bruja su vecina, tarde y noche, un remedio buscará
Porque el fuego no lo calma ni el ventilador
Podria pasar mi vida con aquel (gigante)
Que todo el mundo teme (teme)
Y si me acerco hasta tocar su mano
Me dice que es solo un ser humano

People don't know much
Need a whiskey crutch
To think of something new
Hey you watching me
Lookin' through a screen
I'm here in front of you

Sometimes the days, they feel so long
Yeah, we all live under the same sun

So I hit my head up against the wall
Over and over and over and over again, and again
'Cause I don't wanna be like them
I hit my head up against the wall
Over and over and over and over again, and again, and again

People piss you off
Some you say you love
Those you call a friend
Walking through a crowd
Then you look around
See there's no one left

We live and then we die as one
Yeah, we all live under the same sun

So I hit my head up against the wall
Over and over and over and over again, and again
'Cause I don't wanna be like them
I hit my head up against the wall
Over and over and over and over again, and again, and again

I left my heart in Amsterdam
Where I could dream and nights were long
I left my heart in Amsterdam
I hit my head against the wall

Te ame mas de lo normal y pense
Que nuestro amor era
Infinito como el universo
Y hoy se reduce a un verso
No sé donde, ni como estare
Ahora que te has ido
Mi corazon se fue contigo
No sé... no s que hacer conmigo
Quiero olvidar que algun dia
Me hiciste feliz
Pero es inutil fingir
No puedo , no puedo , no puedo
Vivir sin ti
La vida despues de ti
Es un castigo sin fin
Y no sobrevivire

Nada es igual para mi
Me obligo a vivir en velo
Y no sobrevivire

Asi es la vida, la vida despues de ti
Dire que esto no esta matandome
Pero eso no es cierto
Me he vuelto un fantasma eterno
Que habita en tu recuerdo
Y asi lo que un dia fue ya no es

Sólo en sueños verte
De amarte... de amarte
Y de perderte

Amor mío
Si estoy debajo del vaivén de tus piernas
Si estoy hundido en un vaivén de caderas
Esto es el cielo, es mi cielo
Amor fugado
Me tomas, me dejas, me exprimes y me tiras a un lado
Te vas a otros cielo y regresas, como los colibríes
Me tienes como un perro a tus pies

Otra vez mi boca insensata
Vuelve a caer en tu piel
Vuelve a mí tu boca y provoca
Vuelvo a caer de tus pechos a tu par de pies

Labios divididos, mi amor
Yo no puedo compartir tus labios
Y comparto el engaño y comparto mis días y el dolor
Yo no puedo compartir tus labios

Oh, amor compartido
Amor mutante
Amigos con derecho y sin derecho de tenerte siempre
Y siempre tengo que esperar paciente
El pedazo que me toca de ti

Las voces solas lloran en el sol (eh!)
Mi boca en llama es torturada
Te desnudas, ángel hada
Luego te vas

Otra vez mi boca insensata
Vuelve a caer en tu piel
Vuelve a mí tu boca, duele
Vuelvo a caer de tus pechos a tu par de pies
Labios compartidos
Labios divididos, mi amor
Yo no puedo compartir tus labios
Y comparto el engaño y comparto mis días y el dolor
Yo no puedo compartir tus labios
Que me parta un rayo
Que me entierre al olvido, mi amor
Pero no puedo más compartir tus labios
Compartir tus besos...
Labios compartidos
Ooh oh yeah!
Te amo con toda mi fe sin medida
Te amo aunque estés compartida
Tus labios tienen el control
Te amo con toda mi fe sin medida
Te amo aunque estés compartida
Y sigues tú con el control

Me voy pero me llevo
Todo lo que te ofrecí
Si un día dije que te amaba
No lo vuelvo a repetir
Las horas en la madrugada
Cuando no podías dormir
Quién era la que te acompañaba
La que estuvo siempre ahí
Si me lo hubieras pedido
Te juro que yo habría corrido
Hasta el fin del mundo
Para darte mi mano
Pero he ahí lo malo
No fui correspondida
Te perdiste de un enorme corazón
Que se encuentra en estos tiempos
En peligro de extinción
De esos que dan serenata
Pero con su propia voz
Te perdiste de un 14 de febrero
Que comienza el mes de enero
Y se renueva el año nuevo
Te perdiste de lo que no encontrarás
En ningún otro lugar

No sé, ni como voy a reaccionar
Cuando otra vez te vayas
Ves, esta escena se repite siempre
Pero a mí me mata
Y despedirnos es
El momento que quisieramos los dos
Que nunca más llegara
No te has ido todavía y aún así te extraño
Más que demasiado
Ese marco de la puerta lo detesto tanto
Rompe nuestro encanto
Verte salir y alejarte
Me lleva al punto de amarte
Más que demasiado
Más que demasiado
Lo sé, que es tarde y tienes ya que irte
Que así son las cosas
Ves, de nuevo se me va tú boca
Odio ver la hora de decir adiós
Y aunque entiendo que esto pase
El coraje sube y se me nota
No te has ido todavía y aún así te extraño

Don't think I can't feel that there's something wrong
You've been the sweetest part of my life for so long
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light
And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight

Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby, think twice

Baby, think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
For the fire and the faith that was you and me
Babe, I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for a higher ground
'Cause when you're half-way up, you're always half-way down

En el corto tiempo
En que se vive una ilusion
Que podre dejarte
Tan pegado al alma
Que se quede ahi en tu corazon

Lo que es el mundo me falta tambien
Pero vale la pena disfrutar cada dia
Porque me has regalado el privilegio de amarte
Di lo que sientas
Has lo que piensas
Da lo que tengas
Y no te arrepientas
Y si no llega lo que esperabas
No te conformes jamas te detengas
Pero sobre todas las cosas nunca te olvides de Dios
Seras del tamaño
De tus pensamientos
No te permitas fracasar
Lo mas importante
Son los sentimientos y lo que no puedes comprar
Y cuando llegue el momento
En que tu sola quisieras volar
Aunque no estemos juntos
Estaran los recuerdos que con solo quererlo
Volveras a vivirlos
Di lo que sientas has lo que piensas

Pero el domingo me pongo muy fino
Con mi chaque de lino
Y voy buscando por los balcones
Bellas Julietas para mis canciones
Y hacerles los honores

Rompiéndome la voz
Cantando coplas
Bajo tu ventana, amor

Se esta asando de calor
Soy educado caballero
Bello, cortés y amable compañero
Un codiciado soltero
Y como no tengo complejos
Me miro siempre en todos los espejos
Antes de echar los tejos
Si alguna vez cometo errores
Para que no llores pido mil perdones
Con un millón de flores

Letra de ""Llegaste a Mi Vida""

En algún momento me rendí, esto va a ser así
Ya no voy a llegar a donde yo soñaba
Ni encontrar a alguien que sí me amara
Pero la vida me ha enseñado que las cosas son así
Que un día estás arriba, otro estás a un lado
Otro abajo y que la rueda nunca para

Me había dado por vencido
Desilusionado y confundido
Lo que pasa es que no te había conocido

Pero llegaste a mi vida
Cambiaste todo lo que pensaba
Acomodaste lo que sobraba
Sacaste el polvo que me estorbaba
Pero llegaste a mi vida
Me diste todo sin pedir nada
Me regresaste la pasión
Me devolviste la ilusión
Me hiciste el más bello favor
Porque es que hoy creo nuevamente en el amor

Cómo ha cambiado mi sonrisa
Ahora que estás aquí ha vuelto mi alegría
Mis sueños, mi fe al amor que tanto esperaba

Me había dado por vencido
Desilusionado y confundido
Lo que pasa es que no te había conocido

Pero llegaste a mi vida
Cambiaste todo lo que pensaba
Acomodaste lo que sobraba
Sacaste el polvo que me estorbaba
Pero llegaste a mi vida
Me diste todo sin pedir nada
Me regresaste la pasión
Me devolviste la ilusión
Me hiciste el más bello favor

Y dime tú, qué me diste, qué me hiciste
A qué hora fue que te metiste en este tonto corazón
Tú me hiciste ser valiente, tú me hiciste ser mejor

Pues llegaste a mi vida
Cambiaste todo lo que pensaba
Acomodaste lo que sobraba
Sacaste el polvo que me estorbaba
Pero llegaste a mi vida
Me diste todo sin pedir nada
Me regresaste la pasión
Me devolviste la ilusión
Me hiciste el más bello favor
Porque es que hoy creo nuevamente en el amor
Por ti, mi amor
Por ti, mi amor

Como se entregó el rubor
Del mejor atardecer

Que entregarte amor

Ríndete... entrégame tus armas

Tell me what do you see
But you quickly turn your head away
Try to find the words I could use
Don't have the courage to come up to you
My chance is looking a bit gray

Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time

What is it that drives me mad?
Girls like you that I never had
What is it about you that I adore?
What makes me feel so much pain?
That makes me go so insane
What is it about you that I adore?

Staring across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time

Why did you have to leave so soon?
Why did you have to walk away?

Since you took your love away
I go out every night and I sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone, I can do whatever I want
I can see whoever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song, ahh
Nothing can stop these tears from falling down
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every boy I see
They only remind me of you
I went to the doctor, and guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have some fun
No matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named

Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home

Come out upon my seas

Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing—

Cause I was never good at running away
Till you ran away nothing feels the same
See I was cut between the lighted shape
Through the hours of darkness I found your name
I left my heart in the lowest places
Lost all my graces in midnight flames
See I was never good at running away
Till you ran away, eh eh

When are you coming home?
I'm tired of missing you when you're gone
If distance makes our hearts grow stronger
We'll live longer
But I'm dying to know
When are you coming home?
You coming home?

See I was blinded by the neon lights
Lost my eyes to the angels that sold me lies
Empty promisses and warning signs
Left a light burning out like fireflies
No need to talk, baby it's alright
When the words are right
They keep you up at night
Ooohh ooooooooooh

Búscame en tu beso que ahí prendido me quede
Colgado de tus labios para siempre
Esperare a que vistas con tus noches todos nuestros días
Escucha hoy lo que te dice el corazón

No matter what you say about love
I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire
Sooner or later, I get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life
I learn every time I bleed
The truth is a stranger
Soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free, to

Admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry but I have to move on
And leave you behind

I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once
Needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo I'll always have you
I'll always have you
I'll always have you

I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror
It didn't deliver, It hurt enough to think that I could stop

Admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry but I got to be strong
And leave you behind

I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once
Needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you
I'll always have you
I'll always have you

If I live every moment
Won't change any moment
There's still a part of me in you
I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do, oh

I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction

어디로 어디로 넌 자꾸 가려 해
여기에 여기에 있어
곁에 있어도 보고싶다
보고 있어도 보고싶다
그래서 그래서 지금 말하려 해
조용히 오늘 내가
쉬지 않고 달려도
괜한 곳에 기대봐도
돌아오는 길엔
다시 떠오르는 너
하루 온 종일 그대만 떠올라
함께 있으면, 밤이 오는 하늘이 미워져
매일 또 매일 내일을 기대하며
잠이 들 때도 다시 너를 만날 수 있게
눈을 감고 너를 그려
어떤 하루든 어떤 모습이든 너와 있을게
눈을 떴는데 니가 없었어
그 생각을 하니 겁이 나더라
그래서 그래서 지금 전화를 해
거기에 거기에 너 있지?
눈을 감은 채 매일, 이렇게 꿈을 꾸며
깨어나지 말고 우리 여기 남아요
하루 온 종일 그대만 떠올라
함께 있으면, 밤이 오는 하늘이 미워져
매일 또 매일 내일을 기대하며
잠이 들 때도 다시 너를 만날 수 있게
눈을 감고 너를 그려
나는 오늘 하루를 이런 그대와 함께
보내고 있네요
하루 온 종일 온 종일 그대만 떠올라
함께 있으면, 밤이 오는 하늘이 미워져
매일 또 매일 내일을 기대하며
잠이 들 때도 다시 너를 만날 수 있게
눈을 감고 너를 그려

누가 볼까 봐 겁이 나서
하루를 또 망치네
예민한 척을 해도
입꼬리는 올라가 너를 볼 때
어떻게 비춰질까 거울을 보네
Desperate 장난처럼 다가가
바로 얼어붙어 ice
비라도 내렸으면 좋겠다니깐
우산속에라도 숨고 싶네
왜 이럴까 볼 때 마다 넌
느리게 가는 구름 같아
Sweet해 보이는 너의 눈에
자꾸 비가 내려요
안아주고 싶다 내가 미쳤나 봐
구름아 구름아 나를 가려줘
요새 너의 기분이 궁금해
말투 표정 걸음걸이까지 보이네
한 번씩 내뱉는 너의 한숨
걱정은 끝도 없이 쌓여가
I pray 쓸데없는 고민 따위
날려버리고 싶다
하늘에 별이 쏟아질 때까지
나와 얘기 나눌래
왜 이럴까 볼 때 마다 넌
느리게 가는 구름 같아
Sweet해 보이는 너의 눈에
자꾸 비가 내려요
안아주고 싶다 내가 미쳤나 봐
구름아 구름아 나를 가려줘
Cloudy misty 조금은 어둑한 날씨
Windy rainy 바람을 타고
너에게로 가야지
감기들면 안 돼 비에 젖으면 안 돼요
너만을 위해 내 어깨를 내어줄 게
내가 좀 부족하지만
네가 기댈 곳은 넓고 편해
왜 이럴까 볼 때 마다 넌
느리게 가는 구름 같아
Sweet해 보이는 너의 눈에
자꾸 비가 내려요
안아주고 싶다 내가 미쳤나 봐
구름아 구름아 나를 가려줘
When I am with you
I used to be so in love baby
밤을 샐 것 같아도
내일 아침 널 볼 때
안아주고 싶다 정말 진심이야

I've seen it all, I have seen the trees
I've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
I've seen a man killed by his best friend
And lives that were over before they were spent
I've seen what I was — I know what I'll be
I've seen it all — there is no more to see!

You haven't seen elephants, kings or Peru!
I'm happy to say I had better to do
What about China? Have you seen the Great Wall?
All walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!

And the man you will marry?
The home you will share?
To be honest, I really don't care...

You've never been to Niagara Falls?
I have seen water, it's water, that's all...
The Eiffel Tower, the Empire State?
My pulse was as high on my very first date!
Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
To be honest, I really don't care...

I've seen it all, I've seen the dark
I've seen the brightness in one little spark
I've seen what I chose and I've seen what I need
And that is enough, to want more would be greed
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all — there is no more to see!

You've seen it all and all you have seen
You can always review on your own little screen
The light and the dark, the big and the small
Just keep in mind — you need no more at all
You've seen what you were and know what you'll be
You've seen it all — there is no more to see!

Amo que me digas que me amas
Que me beses con tu boca
Sonrojandome hasta el alma
Asomarme a tu ventana
Y despeinarme la costumbre
Ver tu amanecer como ilumina a mi penumbra
Amo que me robes la mirada
El café por la mañana
Y despertar entre tus ramas
Que me mires de reojo
Si cometo una imprudencia
Que mis gestos y mis lábios
Sean de toda tu incumbencia
Doy mi alma, doy mi cuerpo, doy mis huesos
Te entrego todo, hasta las cosas que no tengo
Te doy mis ojos para verme en tu mirada
Te doy mi almohada, la de plumas, la que amas
Por lo que reste de vida
Yo me la paso contigo
Comiendo de tu boca
El tiempo que me queda
Luchando contra el mundo
Y contra la marea
Por lo que reste de vida
Yo me la paso contigo
Comiendo de tu boca
El tiempo que me queda
Luchando contra el mundo
Y contra la marea

Juro que amo todas tus carencias
Aunque prueben mi paciencia
Amo todo si es contigo
Amo eso que senti cuando te vi
Entre todo lo que amo
No amo a nada más que a ti
Doy mi alma, doy mi cuerpo, doy mis huesos
Te entrego todo, hasta las cosas que no tengo
Te doy mis ojos para verme en tu mirada
Te doy mi almohada, la de plumas, la que amas

The knowledge that seeking the favor of another
Means the murder of self
This is the resolution

The death of evolution
It bleeds all life away
Silence speeds the path to the streams of solace that run so few and narrow
Brooks that babble the sounds of torture
Sounds of torture
You will one day rise
To flood the banks of the chosen

And just when we discover that we need each other
Here our lives keep pulling us away
Now we're both so unstable at the kitchen table
With these peanut bagels in a foreign state

Because the point is that I see it's not just me
The point is that you feel my company
I don't wanna say goodbye
Guess I'll see you when the screen is vibrating

It's not just me
I know you're feeling the same way
And I can't fail to believe
When you're feeling the same way
It's not just me
I know you're feeling the same way
And I can't fail to believe
When you're feeling the same way
It's not just me

Back then, I'd just decided I was so misguided
That you'd all forget about me, in time
Bet you remember it was New Year's Eve
Sparklers through Palaced streets
We knew though years do change
We'd always feel the same

Because the point is that I see it's not just me
The point is that you feel my company
You know I'll never be too far if you're looking for somebody
I'm here

It's not just me
I know you're feeling the same way
And I can't fail to believe
When you're feeling the same way
It's not just me
I know you're feeling the same way
And I can't fail to believe
When you're feeling the same way
It's not just me

It seems so hard you’ll start to feel so
Good to know sweeping it under the carpet
It seems so hard you'll start to feel so
Good to know sweeping it under the carpet
And I know when you know

It's not just me
I know you're feeling the same way
And I can't fail to believe

I count the stars crowding my vision
And I feel nothing instead
I feel nothing instead

Soak in decay, spoil into loam
Give what I take but it never feels enough
So, I give nothing instead

Take me to the water

You should know I would never let you drown

Loan by the skin, a vessel with two hands
Touch what I can before I hand it in

No quick head in my bed, I can't have that
I want that long neck, not talking giraffe neck
Ain't no laying down man we 'bout to have late fun
I'm bout' to make your balls stick up like space buns
Want your dick soaked? Place it down my throat
Tongue tickle yo' dick but not telling a joke
Peddle in this pussy, that's how you rock a boat
It get live in this pussy, I'm not talking Periscope
In the sheets I am a bully
Give more head than a hoodie
Every time you make me cum it look just like vanilla pudding
Sit on yo' face all day until you say ""bae it hurt me""
Then I turn around and give the dick more kisses than Hershey's

Yo' dick brick hard like a medal (uhh)
I got 3 holes for it like a pretzel (uhmm)
Tight as a virgin, boy don't get nervous (tight)
I'm here to serve you customer service (right)
I save dick by giving it CPR (I save dick by giving it CPR, YES)
Put my mouth on it like CPR (let's make porn and watch it on VCR)

I think we should fuck up in every zip code
It would make my pussy wetter than a fishbowl
Pussy a kitty cat, I pet it like a pet
I fuck doggy style so much I need to go to the vet
Hotbox? More like a scorching pussy
Open this coochie up like a fortune cookie
Yo' banana in my mouth, watch my tongue go ape
Yo' dick getting more blows than a birthday cake
When I'm near it, no I don't fear it
Licking on that penis like a letter when I seal it
Today way wetter than my past slob
And if you unemployed I can give you a ass job
Pussy already wet don't need no lube ointment
Dick twisting in my stomach like food poison
That's how you know when you hit the spot
I'll make your pants unzip more than Ziploc

Anything goes when you up in my hole
Dirty panties from the sex, yeah I got me some loads
Listen, I'm the most explicit
Long stick inside my river but we not going fishing
Know what to do every time you have a horrible day
I'll eat that sausage all day like it's Memorial Day
I'm talking barbecue sauce and mustard on it
And the mayonnaise comes when you bust right on it
Name anything freaky and you know I'm 'bout the shit
Only time I'm not on the dick is when I'm 'bout to shit
Pubic hairs all in my mouth, not again
So when I suck yo' dick now I use bobby pins
Who need a gym when you got dick to work you out?
I want my face to lose weight so stroke my mouth
And any time my pussy wanna be hairy like Harry Potter
Becky with the good hair is what you could call her
Let's get it

A little faster
A little more
Right there

Yeah.  This the one they told me not to put out.  But you got to give the people what they want.  So brothers, sisters, I’ve been holding this one back.  This one for y’all.  Let’s go

I'm feeling numb, thinking of changing my name to Crystal Meth
I’m playing this game, holding my mic like a pistol, aiming at death
And I love nobody.  Alone in this world—that's how I came in it
But shit could flash and reverse the same in a minute
I don't even love life no more—my niggas, I just live it
And I don't love love.  All the hurting is infinite
I cry myself to sleep sometimes, wept a gallon of tears
From malice, divorced mates to lost peers
Drowned it in a haze of smoke and glasses that never ran empty
Bottles of So-Co, cheap vodka and 20/20
Spending my pennies for thoughts on quarts of Henny
Fame?  Got none.  Pain?  Like the movie, have plenty
Like a shotgun, double-barrel fully loaded, ready to blow
I want to turn around and aim at myself
Been failing my health.  I hardly even eat no more
My lunch is munchies from the corner store, tropical fantasy
Me and my family, me and my niggas used to be tight
But now we see each other on the block with no pounds
And keep it moving.  Gotta move on
I know I’m doing it right.  I’m still living, hustling life
Still, shit

For all my niggas, smoke a pack a day
For all my niggas, hold a bottle, drink the pain away
What type of life is this?
For all my niggas getting the cash and all my niggas who chill on the ave
Let’s keep living
For all my niggas, drink the pain away
For all my niggas, smoke a pack of Newports a day
What type of life is this?
For all my niggas getting the cash and all my niggas who chill on the ave
Let’s keep living.  Let’s keep living

Grew up a child of an alcoholic, sister to schizophrenic
And already inherited one and they both are genetic
When sun falls, I gets no sleep.  Nights is filled
With party and bullshit, Bacardi and full clips
Just to deal with it.  Got a full heart, but I don't feel
With it no more.  I have fury of woman who scorned
Just live my life like the X-Files and trust nobody
Forgetting everyone.  Now I'm just for getting the money
Funny how shit can change and switch up, fragile to rip on you
Spent too much of my young life just trying to stitch shit up
Uh.  I'm living day-by-day now.  Every step is play-by-play
Hand to mouth.  I'm just trying to make the moments count
Eyes read, stressing my soul.  Chest grows
From heavy smoking addict since nine.  A nicotine addict
Devoted at it but, still, I need some type of release
I quit the trees at least
Yo, I'm learning, niggas, but I'm slow at it
Always gave my motherfuckers the benefit of the doubt
But it seems that everybody’s just out for self
I used to love her.  Now I gotta make her work for my wealth
I gotta eat, y'all

For all my niggas, smoke a pack a day
For all my niggas, hold a bottle, drink the pain away
What type of life is this?
For all my niggas getting the cash and all my niggas who chill on the ave
Let’s keep living
For all my niggas, drink the pain away
For all my niggas, smoke a pack of Newports a day
What type of life is this?
For all my niggas getting the cash and all my niggas who chill on the ave
Let’s keep living.  Let’s keep living

It’s from rapping to nicotine, niggas clapping and niggas’ll fiend
From some shit I haven’t seen to everything I’ve been through
It's like losing the love of your life twice in the same night
Being deaf for years, gained your hearing and losing your sight
Trying to shine but I’m just getting eclipsed
I'm just trying to find the perfect words to fall from my lips
Thinking too hard about what shit has fallen—mainly the chips
Hoping the next time it’s storming, that I'm not attempting to slit wrists
Got nothing now.  I’ll work my way up from the bottom
To the top of the ladder, claim what's rightfully mine
I’m working against time.  It's been too long
And I haven't even had a chance to leave y'all yet.  I apologize
Getting older, wiser, seen the picture painted
My destiny fated for this and not for easy times
I put my heart in these rhymes for always
Love it or leave it or ready to die
Yeah, I’m ready.  Come on

Piped up in the city
Piped up with yo bitches
Piped up in Givenchy
Piped up new edition
When a nigga start talking shit, gotta pipe up the ammunition
Your bitch walkin' around piped up

They biting the flow nigga but the Migos got the title
So now niggas dabbing, don't know how it happen

Don't forget bitch I'm the dab daddy
In stores now YRN fashion (Yung Rich Nation!)
Pipe it up, bitch it's gon' be the new anthem

Pull out the camo when you see me Christian Louboutin, hopping out that's an animal
Now remember, fore we made this song, nobody said pipe it up
Next thing we dropping, we gon' fuck em up, have everybody screaming pipe it up
Pipe it up in the club while I'm on drugs
A nigga fucking up the furniture
Shoot a money ball like Steve Kerr

I was nurtured, I was sheltered
I was curious and young
I was searching for that something
Trying to find it on the run
Oh, and just when I stopped looking
I saw just how far I'd come
In this life, in this life

You give me love
You give me light
Show me everything that's been happening
I've opened up my eyes
I'm following three steps
Fight an honest fight
Two hearts that can start a fire
One love is all I need in this life

I have faltered, I have stumbled
I have found my feet again
I've been angry and I've been shaken
Found a new place to begin
My persistence to make a difference
Has led me safe into your hands
In this life, in this life

You give me love
You give me light
Show me everything that's been happening
I've opened up my eyes
I'm following three steps
Fight an honest fight
Two hearts that can start a fire
One love is all I need in this life
In this life

I was put here for a reason
I was born into this world
And I'm living and I'm believing
That I was meant to be your girl
In this life, in this life

You give me love

Show me everything that's been happening

If it's okay
I'll leave the bed light on
And place your water glass where it belongs
And if it's alright
I'll lie awake at night
Pretending I am curled up at your side
See I'm circling in these patterns
Living out of memories
I'm still a long way from accepting it
That there's just no you and me
But if I still believe you love me
Maybe I'll survive
So I tell myself you're coming home
Like you've done a million times
And if it's alright
I'll still be loving you
'Cause I can't break it to my heart
Is it just me
Did I commit a crime
I won't believe that loving you
Is just a waste of time
Or was it in my head
I'm reading into things you never said
'Cause I still don't have the answers
To why we couldn't work it out

Are you swimming upstream, in notions of blue?
Do you feel like you're sinking?
Are you sick of the rain, after all you've been through
Well I know what you're thinking
When you can't take it, you can make it
Sometime soon I know you will see
'Cause when you're in your darkest hour
And all of the light just fades away
And when you're like a single flower
Whose colours have turned to shades of grey
Well hang on
Be strong
You're taking each step one day at a time
You can't lose your spirit
Well let live and let live
Forget and forgive
And it's all how you see it
And just remember, keep it together
Don't you know you're never alone?
'Cause when you're in your darkest hour
And all of the light just fades away

Recall
The earth-shattering exchange
What did you gain?
And what was lost, what was lost?

Forget what they say
Step into the ancient world
Where blood meets the sea
And stale limbs hang off the old

In the mirror there’s a shimmer of a ghost trying to awake
I’ve been trying so hard to make no big mistakes
Higher states, now we resonate, bodies slipping into place
If this is still the same cage, then take me far away

When was
The last time you spread your wings
And flew towards the closest blonde
To fall from grace, fall from grace?

Forget what they say
(Forget what they say)
Step into the ancient world
(Step into the ancient world)
Where blood meets the sea
When faith was free instead of sold

In the mirror there’s a shimmer of a ghost trying to awake
I’ve been trying so hard to make no big mistakes
Higher states, now we resonate, bodies slipping into place
If this is still the same cage, then take me far away

And the sun, it starts to open up our eyes

I ain't even gon’ lie, 2019 I'm 'bout to be on my singin’ shit
Like, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi
Fuck you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Take your bitch this year and shit
That's gon' be the reason why

All of my peers is threatened by me
I can tell, I can see jealousy livin' in need
These niggas sick 'cause I won't quit
They stuck in the sea, stuck in the wave
Stuck in the deep end of the spectrum
They drownin', they floaties ain't working
Should’ve just stuck to the beats
Even though your body is a he, you really a she
Fans’ll say your rappin' is a A when it’s really a D
They get a B for brainwash, the sucky disease
Worst part of that is you believe, sneeze
I'm cold as 23 degrees below the only number startin' with a Z
That's why they sleep, so I’ma crank the heat
So hot, the helium's makin' it hard for them to breathe (Ahh)
I'm still independent, I run my own shit (Run my own shit)
I can't say the same for niggas I've grown with (Grown with)
But keep it real, I'd rather split half of a mill'
Than keep the whole hunnid, so my deal with **** is comin'
I heard so-and-so say so-and-so's they only competition
I started laughin', you must be kiddin'
'Cause if so-and-so drop another so-and-so
You and I know your conversation is good riddance
With good mittens, you couldn't catch any ball I'm pitchin'
But this ain't a game of bars, no
This is a game about who you with and who you know
And if you with them niggas at the top, then you could blow
So here I go

I gotta keep a chopper on the table in front of the Bible
So right before I spray, I pray
That don't nobody try me, high-key
Make 'em grow wings and make 'em fly away

I wish a nigga would try me, I'm trigger happy
I wish a nigga would try me, gon' make me happy
I wish a nigga would try me, I'm trigger happy
I wish a nigga would try me, gon' make me happy

This the shit that make Carl Chery neck snap
This the shit that make Rob Markman pimp slap
Your favorite blogger who's callin' himself an author
But never wrote shit about who I fathered, and that's awful
I know how this goes, you niggas sleep 'til I make a heap
Then all of a sudden you on my meat, proceed to beat
But nigga guess what, I'll never skeet
'Cause I will never be turned on by a fuckin' leech, capeesh?
Logic and his manager tried to ruin my deal
I guess that's what happens when you tell a nigga
Who spent his whole career proving that he's black
That he ain't black still
But when you taking food out my fridge, I ain't gotta chill
And that for real, this ain't a diss
He won't respond, this ain't a risk
This is me sayin' none of you bigger artists can cock-block shit
This industry is a bitch
I been patiently waitin' to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the IDK show
It's the same as before with a lot better flow
And the melodies and the hooks that prolly take your ho, like

I gotta keep a chopper on the table in front of the Bible
So right before I spray, I pray
That don't nobody try me, high-key
Make 'em grow wings and make 'em fly away

I wish a nigga would try me, I'm trigger happy
I wish a nigga would try me, gon' make me happy
I wish a nigga would try me, I'm trigger happy
I wish a nigga would try me, gon' make me happy

Ayy, Eddie
Ayy, make sure you leave a little bit of, um, instrumental
So they can loop that shit and, and, a-a-and rap over it and shit
Matter fact, matter fact
I'ma just drop the instrumental with this song
That's a good idea, I'ma drop the instrumental with this song
I'ma put it out with the instrumental, yeah

We're smashing mics in karaoke bars
You're running late with half your make-up on
This method acting might pay our bills
But soon enough there'll be a different role to fill

I love this feeling, but I hate this part
I wanted this to work so much, I drew up our plans on a chart
Cars are flipping; I'm in hot pursuit
My character's strong, but my head is loose

She hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me…

The tarot cards say it's not so bad
And the blades rotate; there's just no landing pad
And better have said it but, darling, you're the best
I'm just tired of falling up the Penrose steps

I hate this feeling
But I love this part
She really wants to make it work
And I clearly want to let it start
We'll build a water slide
As soon as I get home

Oh and she hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me
It's wrong but surely worse to leave
She hits like ecstasy

So free up the cheaper seats

Pardon me sugar I’m the man underneath your thumb
But I won’t take your violence and I won’t chew your bubblegum
White heat, indiscreet, any day now obsolete
Though you’ve seen your best days
I would still walk down your empty street
Well you look like salvation but you taste like a refugee
Well you say you got no soul but you look like you do to me

Well I’ve been pushing up daisies
Just to catch a glimpse of something real
When I see you coming
I might just as well give up and kneel
Well if you saw me broken
Would you put me out my misery?

Purple pavements
Crooked fingers knocking on windows without souls
Bodies are swinging from rooftops and poles
Howling through hollows
Restless nights and one night cheap hotels
Oh, am I only drifting to always come back?
And I search for something
Oh, whatever I don’t really care
Driving with their lights off they can be anywhere
Rolling down their windows
Open car with open mouths
Golden teeth and golden cards
You cover your eyes
You cover your mouth
You cover your ears
Still you follow my trail
I’ll do it all, I’ll do whatever you say
God has left me anyway
Lava laiden pavements
Stars with stains and the heaven and afterglow
Beneath the ashes are echoes buried alive
They are howling through hollows
Once we shared their temple of halls
Now our heads are hung up on walls
We are ruins within ruins
On every corner a gladiator is begging for another century
When no one cut your tongue to know nothing and to know it all
To be both the animal and god
You cover your eyes
You cover your mouth
You cover your ears
Still you follow our trail

You cover your mouth

They whisper:

And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

Llegaste sin avisar
Y el calor de tu cuerpo
Llenó el vacío en mí
Se sintió tan real
Y poquito a poquito
Me fui fundiendo en ti

Con cada segundo
Más quiero de ti
Adicto a tu mundo
No quiero salir
Trazas el destino
Que quiero vivir
Eres tú el camino
Que quiero seguir


Busqué y no pude encontrar
En el mundo otros labios
Que me hicieran sentir así
Tan especial es
La manera de hablar de tus ojos
Al mirarme así

Letra de ""El Chisme""
Hoy te veo con él
Y se me viene a la mente tu piel
No pude explicarte
Cómo fueron las cosas
Salí perdiendo, quemé nuestro tiempo
No hay nada que hacer

Nena te llegaron con un chisme increíble
Y tú les creíste, claro que lo hiciste
Cosas del pasado nos dejaron cicatrices
Hoy me voy, aunque no me quisiera ir

Y pa' que rogar
Si es el final de una discusión de nunca acabar
Te llenaron de dudas, te bajaron la luna
Te ganó la inseguridad
Y aunque no estés, sé que después
Tu corazón querrá volver
Por las cosas que dejó en mi cama
Si no es que el orgullo te gana
Yo quisiera quedarme pero tengo que irme
Ah-ahh

Nena te llegaron con un chisme increíble
Y tú les creíste, claro que lo hiciste
Cosas del pasado nos dejaron cicatrices
Hoy me voy, aunque no me quisiera ir
Nena te llegaron con un chisme increíble
Y tú les creíste, claro que lo hiciste
Cosas del pasado nos dejaron cicatrices
Hoy me voy, aunque no me quisiera ir

Oye nena, te vieron de mí hablando
Que por ahí me estas extrañando
Ay, que pena me da mujer
Oye nena, te vieron de mí hablando
Que por ahí me estas extrañando
Y el orgullo te va poder

Hoy te veo con él
Y se me viene a la mente tu piel
No pude explicarte
Cómo fueron las cosas
Salí perdiendo, quemé nuestro tiempo
No hay nada que hacer

Nena te llegaron con un chisme increíble
Y tú les creíste, claro que lo hiciste

Bien caro tendrás que pagar todo mi sufrimiento

Así te darás de cuenta que si te engañan duele

Y después vendrás a mi, pidiéndome perdón
Pero ya mi corazón, no se acuerda más de ti

It's forever pussy nigga gotta deal with it (rich nigga!)

Broke niggas stand to the left
My rich niggas stand to the right
Lil' mama, she keep looking at me (lil' mama!)
I'ma knock the pussy out like fight night
Hit it with the left, hit it with the right
I'ma knock the pussy out like fight night
Beat it with the left, beat it with the right
I'ma knock the pussy out like fight night

Float like a butterly, sting like a bee
Rumble, young nigga, rumble!
Lil' mama want a nigga like me in the sheets
Ice Cube knock it out like Deebo
Now who's that talking that gangsta shit?
Somebody gonna kick your ass
When I walk up in the club I better make a thunderstorm
Let them know that this a whole lot of cash
Rich niggas on the right, all night (rich nigga)
Broke niggas to the left, by yourself (brokanese)
Now who the hell just said that the roof on fire?
Call 911 like Wyclef

I'm a rich nigga, I don't like a bitch nigga
Snitch nigga, broke nigga, I don't deal with you
All of my niggas, official, my bitches they skrippers
My niggas they criminals trying to get to the M&Ms
If your bitch is so innocent, why she sucking my children
Lights, camera, action, diamond dancing bitch we go in the building
Bad bitch make it clap, like Magnolia
Young rich nigga on the couch talking to Oprah
Bottles in the VIP while I stand on the sofa
I don't speak your language, Brokanese, I thought I told ya
These bitches they be smokin' on hookah, my nigga ballin' like Hoosiers
Pull up in the Double R, go scare ya bitch, Freddy Krueger
Flooded Franck Muller

Things haven't been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never, ever, ever gonna let it go

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your
Secret with me

Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reason why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along
What I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever loving anybody else

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you loved me
The start of nothing, I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you loved me
The start of nothing, I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screaming my name, the feeling deep down is good

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you loved me
The start of nothing, had no chance to prepare
Couldn't see you coming
And we started from nothing, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
Did you mean to? Mean to...
I've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
I've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
I've been dreaming, dreaming

Deep in the play
I see you as you are lookin' over
Friends in my way
You never could've been a good lover

Watch what you say
Could never mean a word and still hurt you
Look the other way
Just tell me that I'm wrong
So wrong

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

Forty-nine days
Surely I should be feelin' whole lot better
Ways and ways
You keep on comin' back
I keep lettin' you in

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough

You know that you were never good enough

There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said
To make you turn away
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
(Touch your face)
But the truth remains you're

Gone (You're)
Gone (Baby you're)
Gone (Girl you're gone, baby girl you're)
Gone (You're)
Gone (You're)

Now I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone...no, no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
The time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
(Guess that's my life without you)
And maybe I could change my every day
But baby I don't want to

So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you take my mind off missing you
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do (Yeah)

Ohhh...

What will I do
If I can't be with you
Tell me where will I turn to
Baby who will I be
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart
Baby why don't you see
That I need you here with me
Oohhh...

My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you looking up to me and talking down?
Can't you see I am the big man?
God level I am the I am (whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam
In the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick; Noé
Up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back
Yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, poppin'
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016 burnt some discs
2017 ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, ""issa knife""
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick
Clips on clips like Mike
It's really all

I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it driving itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa
My Amex and Mastercards
I got new money
And it's all cash
I got new bags
And they all collabs

It's been left ticking there too long

Some days there's nothing left to learn

And there's a hurting thing inside

Look inside, look inside your tiny mind
Then look a bit harder
'Cause we're so uninspired, so sick and tired
Of all the hatred you harbour
So you say it's not okay to be gay
Well, I think you're just evil
You're just some racist who can't tie my laces

You want to be like your father, his approval you're after
Well, that's not how you find it
Do you, do you really enjoy living a life that's so hateful?
'Cause there's a hole where your soul should be
You're losing control of it
And it's really distasteful

Sandy blonde hair, the way it came tumbling down
Just like a waterfall
And if you need a light
I'll be the match to your candle
My darling, I'm ready, to burst into flames for you

I was just coasting till we met
You remind me just how good it can get

Well I've been on fire, dreaming of you
Tell me you don't
It feels like you do
Looking like that, you'll open some wounds
How does it start?
And when does it end?
Only been here for a moment, but I know I want you
But is it too soon?
To know that I'm with you
There's nothing I can do

And sometime around one
We fell asleep to escape from the sun
And we woke up to the sound of a storm outside
We stood at your front door
You looked at me and said ""Baby, this rain changes everything""
And my heart ran away from me

I was just coasting till we met
You remind me just how good it can get

Well I've been on fire, dreaming of you
Tell me you don't

Somebody broke me once
Love was a currency
A shimmering balance act
I think that I laughed at that
And I saw your face and hands
Coloured in sun and then
I think I understand
Will I understand?

Will we fight, stay up late?
In my dreams, I'm to blame
Different sides of the bed
Roll your eyes, shave my head
Now we're stuck in the storm
We were born to ignore
And all I got is a chance to just say
(Baby love me you've got me, runaway)

You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money

I slept on my own those nights
Was still in my parents' house
And I cut off my t-shirt sleeves
And claim a new continent
'Til I saw your face and hands
Covered in sun and then
I think I understand
Will I understand?

Will we fight, stay up late?
In my dreams, I'm to blame
Different sides of the bed
Roll your eyes, shave my head
Now we're stuck in the storm
We were born to ignore
And all I got is a chance to just say

Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money
(Baby love me you've got me, runaway)

When you're looking at your shadow
Standing on the edge of yourself
Praying on the darkness
Just don't take the money
Dreaming of an easy
Waking up without weight now
And you're looking at the heartless
Just don't take the money

You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it

Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Well, don't take the money

Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

All I got is time
And I'm gon' spend  that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room

Darling I've been working all week (yeah)
I've got so much on my plate
Always saying ""poor me""
Although my boss is an a-hole
That's when you call me
Said you've been making a plan
To hit the road with me  (yeah)
I'll pick you up after and-

We'll hit the coast on the late night
Make love 'til daylight
I love it when you play with my hair
You know it feels so nice
And I'll do what you like
Naked in the moonlight
We don't care if we are broke
When love is all we own, I'm singin'

I'm singin' hey babe
Two jobs on minimum wage
Although the rent's late
Still got a smile on my face (ha-ha-ha)
We ain't got the sunshine
But we got hearts in our chest
To feel the love like this
Stronger than anyone else

We'll hit the drive-thru, like Lil' Wayne
We ain't got no platinum chains
But hand-me-downs are all the rage (aye!)
So let me spend this pocket change
We'll drink beer like it's champagne (champagne)
And stay out kissin' in the rain

Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, ""How do you like the show?"" She said, ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man,"" she tried to pretend
She said, ""No I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say, ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this

You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend

PSK we're making that green
People always say, ""What the hell does that mean?""
P for the people who can't understand
How one homeboy became a man
S for the way we scream and shout
One by one I'm knocking you out
K for the way my DJ cutting
Other MC's, man you ain't saying nothing
Rocking on to the break of dawn
I think Code Money, your time is on


Driving in my car down the avenue
Towing on a j, sipping on some brew
Turned around, see the fly young lady
Pull to the curb and park my Mercedes
Said ""Fly lady, now you're looking real nice
Sweeter than honey, sugar and spice""
Told her my name was MC Schoolly D
All about making that cash money
She said, ""Schoolly D, I know your game
Heard about you in the hall of fame""
I said, ""Mama, mama, I tell you no lies
Cause all I wanna do is to get you high
And uh - lay you down and do the body rock""
Took a walk to the corner, got into the car
Took a little trip to a fancy bar
Copped some brew, some j, some coke
Tell you now, brother, this ain't no joke
She got me to the crib, she laid me on the bed
I fucked her from my toes to the top of my head
I finally realized the girl was a whore
Gave her ten dollars, she asked me for some more


Clinton Road one Saturday night
Towing on a cheeba I was feeling alright
Then my homie-homie called me on the phone
His name is Chief Keith, but we call him Bone
Told me 'bout this party on the Southside
Copped my pistol, jumped into the ride
Got at the bar, copped some flack
Copped some cheeba-cheeba, it wasn't wack
Got to the place, and who did I see
A sucker-ass nigga trying to sound like me
Put my pistol up against his head
And said, ""You sucker-ass nigga I should shoot you dead""
A thought ran across my educated mind
Said, man, Schoolly D ain't doing no time
Grabbed the microphone and I started to talk
Sucker-ass nigga, man, he started to walk

But at least there's money coming in

Until you had your house paid off

Take it down low like just stretching
Pick it back up like I'm flexing

Werk!
Werk like a Boss

Talk talk talk talk talk talk talk
That's what everybody and they mama wanna do
Whomp whomp whomp
Remote please, mute!
You can have your pennies and your two cent 'tude
(oh my God that's so messed up, how dare she say that in a song
Anti-fem, she's so wrong. I'm gonna post this on my blog)
Take a hike! Matter'o fact--jog
I've been running what took so long
I've been gunning for the top (boy stop!)
I've been reviving this thing, Ben Taub
If you took it upon yourself to take your self so literal
You're missing on the minerals to liberate your inner liberal
Generally i don't give a rat's patootie
But you pursued me
So here's my battle cry against those who slew me, who never knew me
(Big girl, small world)

Do I need to re-remind you that you sipping from the C-h-a-l-i-c-e
And I'm doing all this for the W-E?

Getting dirt for the turf like a workaholic
But your worth cop a shirt 'cuz you work is na-na
Niggahs can't pay rent putting hustle in their mou-mou
Grasp for the raps for the stack when they can. Do
Slack, and I have to attack and offend you
Smashing these tracks...and that's what I'm into

Lookin like a girl cause I'm keeping it youthful
Such a freakin lady, classy and beautiful
Thinking like a man, for those who don't understand
Is having two grips to gain the upper hand
If you had the courage to give me reprimand to my face
Instead of slight of hand, you da Man!

Toe to toe, dancing very close
Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotised
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movements and a wild attack
Face to face, sadly solitude
And it's finger pop
It's 24-hour shopping in Rapture

Fab Five Freddie told me everybody fly
DJ's spinning I said my oh my
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
Francois sais pas, Flashe no deux
And you don't stop, sure shot
You go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and you drive real far
And you drive all night, then you see a light
And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run, but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
Then you're in the man from Mars
And you go out at night, eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns, too, Mercuries and Subarus
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars
You go out at night and you eat up bars
Where the people meet face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man, dance toe to toe
Don't move too slow, 'cause the man from Mars
Is through with cars, he's eatin' bars
Yeah, wall to wall, door to door
Hall to hall, he's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture, be pure
Take a tour, through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, just paint a train
And you'll be singin' in the rain
I said, don't stop, do the punk rock
Don't stop, do the punk rock
Don't stop, do the punk rock
Don't stop, do the punk rock
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
When the, uh, when the TV's on
And now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
And he only eats guitars, get up
And he only eats guitars, get up
And he only eats guitars, get up

I woke up depressed as fuck
I wanna sit around and tell you how it sucks
How it's hard to walk with spaghetti legs
And a mind that’s freaking out about the world we're in
I feel like quicksand, sucking me down to my last limb
I'm at the bottom of the ocean and I can’t swim
I'm at the bottom of the ocean and I might just quit

I keep the TV on to drown out the sound
My mind is way too loud
My mind's way too loud
I keep the TV on to drown out the sound
My mind is way too loud
My mind's way too loud (Shh)

They don't make 'em like
Turn the TV off
But they ours to fight
Boys with the, boys with the

Went to bed feeling sick again
I try to stop the voices in my head
Holding on tight while my room spins
Take a deep breath as the fear sets in
I love distractions
Taking my mind off of life 'cause
Everything thing about it makes me anxious
Every single day, I try to cope with it

I keep the TV on to drown out the sound
My mind is way too loud
My mind's way too loud
I keep the TV on to drown out the sound
My mind is way too loud
My mind’s way too loud (Shh)

I wake up every morning feeling like slapping a nigga
Squeeze trigger, stay scheming then I realize I'm still dreaming
Oops, psych! believing in believers ability to still scream for a nigga till you get nosebleeds
I be so scuffed up from kicking them rocks
And if you're so tough come run up and get clocked
Tick tock tock tock
If you got them slippery socks
Yo i'mma give it all that i got
To make a nigga slide in the vault
Then bake a nigga dash in some salt
I bring a nigga home and pole vault
Then blame a nigga like it's your fault
(you're fault!)
I never understood and i will never understand
The tolerance for ho-ishness that some of you people have
""ME?"" You, yeah you
I'm talking to the middle man
Like how you're content with giving someone else the upper hand
Walking around your cubicle, your tie with your coffee mug
Syphoning the hard earned work from the thugs and hustlers, cuz
Takin a chill pill before i whip my sword out like uma in kill bill
Makin niggas gasp like Emmitt Till
And i'mma keep on giving you the gospel like God's will, Peace! Be Still

This is God's will peace be still
Can I fall in love before the world ends?
Can my record get a few major spins? I'm saying
I don't wanna think about tomorrow because i'm still hustling
Until then, i guess it's just me, you, theses food stamps and cravings
No raisins in the sun, just Funyins and a Sunkist, we up in the club making it mist
Like a missed alcohol (though i see it every night)
And that tylenol i take everyday period like midil
Bye y'all, i'm moving on to other things by y'all
But not quite bilateral, more like three floors up and down the hall
Let the bygones be bygones, and try to keep the peace like Obama and Biden
All my friends are talented, all my friends got mad skills
All my girlfriends wear heels, all my niggas drug deal
We're tight (psych!)

There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day...

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan and
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...

Que echaba tanto de menos su casa

Imagina que es una diana
Con todas esas agujas clavadas
Bromea sobre su suerte, le hace sentirse mas fuerte

Something in the air is calling me
Turn the light on
Something about the night that makes you see
What you don’t want
I think about it every time I sleep
There is someone creeping at me
Swear they're haunting me
Telling me, “Run”

Ooh, I feel my body move without me again
Ooh, like a sleepwalker getting closer to him
Getting closer to him

I think I might be going crazy now
Someone stop me
Forgot to lock the doors to keep me in
Didn’t hide the key
I feel the cold air, I feel the dirt under my toes
Something tells me that I’m far away
And I’m not alone

Ooh, I feel my body move without me again
Ooh, like a sleepwalker getting closer to him
Getting closer to him

Now we’re alone
Whispers disturb a quiet home
No one will know
No one, darling
Come close

Ooh, I feel my body move without me again
Ooh, like a sleepwalker getting closer to him
Ooh, I feel my body move without me again
Ooh, like a sleepwalker getting closer to him
Ooh, I feel my body move without me again
Ooh, like a sleepwalker getting closer to him
Ooh, I feel my body move without me again

(Bang!)
I can hear the shots, when the fireworks soar, and the sounds of the battle
(Drop down!)
Drop down, know I'm on top; when the arrows are drawn, the sergeant's on the saddle
This ain't the type of love that sees a lot of give and take
And I don't know how we push and pull, but I know we'll never break
Bang, bang, I can hear the shots
But I like the way you feel in the flames of the candle

Too late to leave these walls
This castle's been surrounded
Won't stay to watch it fall around us

Bring the big guns out, shoot now
I'll make the drums beat harder for you
Red on the ground, bleed out
I'll rub the colors on my face to prove
I'll sing it like
Whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Watch me put my war paint on, my war paint on
Whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Watch me put my war paint on, my war paint on

I move my troops on the map
When your allies and your tribes are telling you to leave me
They won't see my plan of attack
Cause this is our fight; love is not the enemy
Everything that you do gives me some power, makes me feel alive
So take the gun, I'm your Bonnie, you can be my Clyde
I know that you feel the same
So paint it on your face and, baby, let the world see

Too late to leave these walls
This castle's been surrounded
Won't stay to watch it fall around us

Bring the big guns out, shoot now
I'll make the drums beat harder for you
Red on the ground, bleed out
I'll rub the colors on my face to prove
I'll sing it like
Whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Watch me put my war paint on, my war paint on
Whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Watch me put my war paint on, my war paint on

It's not easy, but I'll draw my knife for you
It's not easy, but I'll draw my knife for you again

Bring the big guns out, shoot now
I'll make the drums beat harder for you
Red on the ground, bleed out
I'll rub the colors on my face to prove
I'll sing it like

Our love's for real
How'd it take a long, long time
To let us feel?
Try to relate in my state
And the aura around me says
My love is for real

Touching your face
How'd it take a long, long time
To be here?
Turning the wheel on my street
My heart still skips a beat
It's echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing

I want to be in love

If you want to I'll take you out
And I got the feeling
That I'm going to keep you up all…
Going to keep you up all…

Tired of taking orders
Coping with disorders
The wrong men have the power
It's turning my milk sour
Turning my milk sour
Turning my milk sour

You got problems? Well, so have I
And I got the feeling
That I'm going to keep you up all…
Going to keep you up all…
Going to keep you up all night

There's cobras in the moshpit
Finally we lost it
Every day is brutal
Now we're being watched by Google
Got to keep it simple
Sending out a signal
Everyone's on bugle
Now we're being watched by Google
Being watched by Google
Being watched by Google

Ahhhhh hah

Now who got the flav that comes a dime a dozen
Keeps 'em buzzin' thinking that they phat when they wasn't
Welcome to the world of Mack (What?) or Mackman
Like Biggie Smalls might say ""I eat 'em shits like Pac-Man""
I'm incredible better eat ya vegetables (What?)
'Cause, I does what I do (Do it!)
I fake the roof off of soft suckers
Super slackin', macking, full effect mic check, one, two
I'ma reign, rain forever, rain like bad weather
Reign like whoever never
You can't bite my style cause my style ain't a style
That is a style so I can go buck wild
Bet'cha figure you got more funk for flow it ain't so
Flava in ya ear let'cha know
Now I'm about a second from the hook strap ya rap book
Before you get ya wet style shook

Can I get down, get on down can I get down
Can I get down, get on down, can I get down

The Mack's like a superintendent
Burning MC's leaves a foul scent
See I'm like what ya call, king a yes ya'll
My style wreck shit, I mean real shit shit's thick
I come with the ammo
The real whammo stammo stuff that I be droppin
And I wake the great lets warm up the hot plate
I'm changing fate from the neck I'm a castrate
My rap loves to alienate
Shake ya ass to the stake you stunk by dominate
See I ain't scared of you muthafuckas
To me ya all suckers cause I make the ruckus
Don't try to buck us we roll with the cuf
No cuf on the roof bitin' like a sabertooth
I pound on the ground when I get down
So let me get down, let me get down

Can I get down, get on down can I get down
Can I get down, get on down, can I get down

Can leap a tall building, crush the earth for fun
But I'm sayin ain't no fair when MC's run
Lemme tell you what they do when those MC's run
They either run and get manpower or they run and get they guns
Here I stand, the rawest of the raw
We from the Queens town without the four or four
All of the sudden niggas is bustin' and frontin'
Talk about your busting titles when we're your idols
I'm looking through your minds corridor, you every thought transpires
Through the Tribe's attire
We Bad Boys to the heart and post
A Tribe Called Quest, you follow us like coats
Position like a Beamer, y'all need to stop froggin'
If I catch a beat it's in the SP organ
No Name, Ray Tip what's goin' on love?
You know shit is tough and we coming through bugged
The name of the track is ""Get Down""
So let me get down and pound all these MC's in the ground

Can I get down, get on down can I get down
Can I get down, get on down, can I get down
Can I get down, get on down can I get down
Can I get down, get on down, can I get down
Can I get down, get on down can I get down

There's a valley of sorrow in my soul
Where every night I hear the thunder roll
Like the sound of a distant gun
Over all the damage I have done
And the shadows filling up this land
Are the ones I built with my own hand
There is no comfort from the cold
Of this valley of sorrow in my soul
There's a river of darkness in my blood
And through every vein I feel the flood
I can find no bridge for me to cross
No way to bring back what is lost
Into the night it soon will sweep
Down where all my grievances I keep
But it won't wash away the years
Or one single hard and bitter tear
And the rock of ages I have known
Is a weariness down in the bone
I used to ride it like a rolling stone
Now I just carry it alone
There's a highway risin' from my dreams
Deep in the heart I know it gleams
For I have seen it stretching wide
Clear across to the other side
Beyond the river and the flood
And the valley where for so long I've stood
With the rock of ages in my bones
Someday I know it will lead me home. oh, oh, oh...

Lloraron las flores, lloraron los ángeles

Desde aquí en el cielo, donde estamos los muertos
Ya no llores te pido en esta canción

Solo honrar el momento y la felicidad

You gotta be the first to run

We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singin' I lo-lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker

Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you

Wear your heart on your cheek
But never on your sleeve
Unless you want to taste defeat
Rule number four
Gotta be looking pure
Kiss him goodbye at the door
And leave him wanting more, more

This is how to be a heartbreaker

Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you

Cause girls don't want
We don't want our hearts to break, in two
So it's better to be fake
Can't risk losing in love again, babe

Different people have their different ways of living
I chose mine and it was unforgiving
Someone gave me guidance, there was something in it
I put it into practice and I tried to live it
I'm self-dividing and I have no limit
I can't fix it, it's not right
Nothing feels good, it's not right

Watching my world
Make funny faces at its own reflection
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)
So I'll follow my girl
'Til I find myself a sense of direction
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)

I found a subsidence but I overlooked it
Someone gave me guidance and for once I took it
I put it in perspective and I see so clearly
I'm part of a collective, oh I nearly reached it
In the distance, caught the light
I can fix it, make it right

Watching my world
Make funny faces at its own reflection
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)
So I'll follow my girl
'Til I find myself a sense of direction
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)

It was wrong, we'll have never worked
Or at least I tell myself
To not make it hurt
I try to blast music
In attempt to get you out of my eyes
But I can't escape my mind

I hate you 'cause I've always
Look at your picture
And I tell myself that I'm over you
But then I get a little unsure

I wish I could get you out of my mind
But I think about it all the time
And I wish I could not think for once in my life
But when I see your face, I can't escape my mind

I know we were never a thing
But I always think about
What could've happened if we kept going
And I never had this happen to me
Only in the movies
But honey, it is happening

I hate you 'cause I've always

See a person like me, smoke weed 'till I hallucinate
I don't know why, crazy right?
This party was dope, that shit got played quick
Yo but the bitches are freaky here

Kool-Aid and frozen pizza
It's a work of art, I ain't talking Mona Lisa
Dream of rocking crowds, see me filling up arenas
This weed got me laughing like a damn hyena
Yeah, I live a life pretty similar to yours
Used to go to school, hang with friends and play sports
Every single summer taking trips to the shore
And that was all gravy but I knew I wanted more
Ain't ever seen a young rapper like moi
Can't believe they eyes, swear its just a mirage
Still got my training wheels in the garage
But I ain't gonna need those, I'ma go hard (Go hard)
So far I've done pretty well for myself
Couple trophies on the shelf so what else
Could I want that I don't have yet
Well, a little more cash and my own fast jet
So I can go anywhere (Anywhere) anywhere (Anywhere)
Cali for the kush, cause boy I know there's plenty there
'Bout to be in music stores everywhere but not yet
They can't understand my concept
I been climbing up the great wall, haven't had a fall yet
These blogs gotta know I'm on next
Clean conscience, good Samaritan
Companies send me clothes so I'm wearing 'em
If you didn't know, well I'm from the 'Burgh
Everything I drop recorded by Big Jerm
I smoke herb and I make music
I don't even talk about it boy, I just do it
Everybody got their own opinion, the reasons why they feeling 'em
You must admit he's killing 'em, running off adrenaline
Waiting for the game to wanna let him in, so open up
The boy a barrel of a smoking gun
Whether I'm old or young, the chosen one
I got a hundred billion flows to come
I hope you know the lyrics to every single song
So when I'm at a show everyone can sing along
My weed bag empty, bottle at its last drop
I'm feeling like this could be my last shot
But many more songs to make cousin
So why the fuck you bugging?

Letra de Volví A Nacer
Puedo no roncar por las mañana
Puedo trabajar de sol a sol
Puedo subirme hasta el Himalaya
O batirme con mi espada
Para no perder tu amor
Puedo ser, tu fiel, chofer, mujer
Todo lo que te imaginas puedo ser
Y es que por tu amor volvía a nacer
Tu fuiste la respiración
Y era tan grande la ilusión
Pero si te vas que voy a hacer
Planchar de nuevo el corazón
Se pone triste esta canción
Coro
Quiero
Casarme contigo
Quedarme a tu lado
Ser el bendecido con tu amor
Por eso yo quiero
Dejar mi pasado
Que vengas conmigo
Morir en tus brazos dulce amor
Por eso yo quiero
Puedo boxear en las olimpiadas
Puedo mendigar por tu amor
Puedo mudarme a la Castellana
Agua fría por las mañanas
Y alinear en el Unión
Puedo ser, tu fiel, chofer, mujer
Todo lo que te imaginas puedo ser
Y es que por tu amor volvía a nacer
Tu fuiste la respiración
Y era tan grande la ilusión
Pero si te vas que voy a hacer
Planchar de nuevo el corazón
Se pone triste esta canción
Coro
Quiero
Casarme contigo
Quedarme a tu lado
Ser el bendecido con tu amor
Por eso yo quiero
Dejar mi pasado
Que vengas conmigo
Morir en tus brazos dulce amor
Por eso yo quiero
Quiero
Casarme contigo
Quedarme a tu lado
Ser el bendecido con tu amor
Por eso yo quiero
Dejar mi pasado
Que vengas conmigo
Morir en tus brazos dulce amor
Puedo boxear en las olimpiadas
Puedo trabajar de sol a sol
Puedo tantas cosas en mi vida
Por tu amor

Letra de La Fantástica
Manuel Zapata me dijo
Domingo Benkos Biohó
Se libertó en Cartagena
Y en la Matuna fundó
Palenque, para escapar de su suerte
Para llamar a su gente
Para cantar por sus penas
Me lo contó
También me dijo Lemaitre
Que España no se rindió
Que los piratas ingleses
A su paciencia colmó
Y levantó una muralla bien fuerte
Para salvar a su gente
Para cuidar su bandera
Me lo contó
Panderos, panderos
Pa' los niños del Ciruelo
Batata, batata
Pa' la alegría de la casa
Dinero, dinero
Pa' los viejos compañeros
Del ámbito musical
De la movida local
Dios bendiga Cartagena
La fantástica
Viva el África
Viva el África
Dios bendiga Cartagena
La fantástica
Viva el África
Viva el África
Batata llamó a Pechiche
Graciela tocó después
Y contestó una leyenda
Llamada Justo Valdez
Y Sofro cantaba así con Senelia
Y en la quemada presente
Como cantando sus penas
Te lo conté
Panderos, panderos
Pa' los niños del Ciruelo
Batata, batata
Pa' la alegría de la casa
Dinero, dinero
Pa' los viejos champeteros
Del ámbito musical
De la movida local
Dios bendiga Cartagena
La fantástica
Viva el África
Viva el África
Dios bendiga Cartagena
La fantástica
Viva el África
Viva el África
Nadie baila como baila la fantástica
Romántica
No tan plástica
Movimiento de cadera iconoclástica
Muy artística
Más elástica

Barú
Bazurto

Letra de Las Cosas De La Vida
Ahora que han pasado algunos años
Y otros labios no cambiaron
El sabor de tu partida
Sabes que no quise hacerte daño
Y no sabes que te extraño
Y otras cosas de mi vida
Que no sabes cuanto te llore
Que morí mil veces cada vez
Que pagué con llanto tus heridas
Y que sepas que no te olvidé
Que otra vez te voy a conocer
Que a quererte mas que en la otra vida
Por que cuando ama un corazón
No hay paciencia ni razón
No hay verdades escondidas
Así son las cosas del amor
No se engaña a un corazón
Con amores de mentira
Así fue, como ves no te olvidé
Hoy nos vemos otra vez
Son las cosas de la vida
Ahora que estas de nuevo a mi lado
Ya las aguas se calmaron
Y escribimos punto aparte
Quiero que me mires a los ojos
Por que tiene mi silencio
Tantas cosas que contarte
Que no sabes cuanto te llore
Que morí mil veces cada vez
Que pagué con llanto tus heridas
Y que sepas que no te olvidé
Que otra vez te voy a conocer
Que a quererte mas que en la otra vida
Por que cuando ama un corazón
No hay paciencia ni razón
No hay verdades escondidas
Así son las cosas del amor
No se engaña a un corazón
Con amores de mentira
Así fue, como ves no te olvidé
Hoy nos vemos otra vez
Son las cosas de la vida
Por que cuando ama un corazón
No hay paciencia ni razón
No hay verdades escondidas
Así son las cosas del amor
No se engaña a un corazón
Con amores de mentira
Así fue, como ves no te olvidé
Hoy nos vemos otra vez
Son las cosas de la vida

Un mediodía que estuve pensando (bis)
En la mujer que me hacía soñar
Las aguas claras del Río Tocaimo
Me dieron fuerza para cantar
Llegó de pronto a mi pensamiento
Esa bella melodía
Y como nada tenía
La aproveche en el momento (bis)
Este paseo es de Leandro Díaz (bis)
Pero parece de Emilianito
Tiene los versos muy chiquiticos
Y bajiticos de melodía
Tiene una nota muy recogida
Que no parece hecho mío
Y era que estaba en el río
Pensando en Matilde Lina (bis)
Este sentimiento se hizo más grande (bis)
Que palpitaba mi corazón
El bello canto de los turpiales
Me acompañaba esta canción
Canción del alma, canción querida
Que para mí fue sublime
Al recordarte Matilde
Sentí temor por mi vida (bis)
Si ven que un hombre llega a la Jagua (bis)
Coge camino y se va pa'l Plan
Esté pendiente que en la sabana
Vive una hembra muy popular
Es elegante todos la admiran
Y en su tierra tiene fama
Cuando Matilde camina
Hasta sonríe la sabana (bis)

That's how it starts
We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out
And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts
And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways we show our age
And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
If the sun comes up and I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
You're talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend
It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except in parts
When the moral kicks in
Though we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's grinding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life
You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be believed
When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of this
Yeah, I know it gets tired only wearing on friends tonight
To tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So when we go
Like a sail's force into the night
And if I made a fool, if I made a fool
If I made a fool on the road, there's always this
And if I'm sewn into submission
I can still come home to this
And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You leave conceit on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tired
You think over and over, hey, I finally did
Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You look concerted on yourself your ridiculous prop
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you always knew you were tired, but then
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight

You wanted a hit
But maybe we don't do hits
I try and try, it ends up feeling kind of wrong
You wanted it tough
But is it ever tough enough?
No, nothing's ever tough enough
Until we hit the road
And you wanted it lush
But honestly, you must hush
No, honestly, you know too much
So leave us, leave us on our own

You wanted a hit
Well, this is how we do hits
You wanted a hit
But that's not what we do, sugar

You wanted it real
But can you tell me what's real?
We've got lights and sounds and stories, music's just a part
Then you wanted the truth
And then you said you want proof
I guess you're used to liars saying what they want

Still, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 'til you take us home

You wanted it smart
But honestly, I'm not smart
No, honestly, I'm never smart
We fake it, fake it all the time
Then you wanted the time
But maybe I can't do time
We both know that's an awful line
But this doesn't make it wrong
You wanted it right
No out of mine and out of sight
No filthy bus and early flight
No seven days and forty nights

You wanted a hit
Please tell me, where's the point in it?
You wanted a hit
But that's not what we do

Still, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home

Living the good life full of goodbyes
My eyes are on the grey skies
Saying I don't want to come home tonight
Yeah, and I'm high up, off what?
I don't even remember
But my friend passed out in the Uber ride

Oh, I'm from the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

Maybe the end is near
But I've been waiting all year
To get the hell up out of here
And throw away my fears
I'm so faded (I'm so faded)
Off of all the things that I've taken, and
Maybe I'm not really drunk
Maybe I'm really good at faking

From the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean

My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen (American teen)

Mmm, oh yeah
We don't always say what we mean

El perfume de su almohada, tu lo conoces bien
Y la humedad de sus sabanas blancas también
Que suerte la tuya que puedes tenerlo a tus pies
Sintiendo en tu boca sus besos que saben a miel

Working at the video store, every day's a bore, I just dream away
DVDs are gone for life, we just get online and go to Pirate Bay
Tripping like I'm on the moon and when I think of being in the disco light

I'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
For a kid a year older than me
And I've been talking to his dad; it makes me so sad
When I think too much about it I can't breathe

And I have this dream where I'm screaming underwater
While my friends are all waving from the shore
And I don't need you to tell me what that means
I don't believe in that stuff anymore

Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will

I have a friend I call
When I've bored myself to tears
And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
But then we laugh until it disappears

And last night I blacked out in my car
And I woke up in my childhood bed
Wishing I was someone else, feeling sorry for myself
When I remembered someone's kid is dead

Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will

And it's 4am, again
And I'm doing nothing

Strained in darkness
Vapour, like a veil, hangs over
The city tonight

Hanging there behind the trees
A blood-red moon is watching
I was waiting for you
Dread in my heart

Where the wind sings by the river
Laughing, broken
Hair swept out into the water
Ripples of black

Run, you better run
You better run for your life

Oh, it rips through the sky
Oh, a light flickers on
Jo, I know you would say
“Don’t wait for me now”

Shiver while you’re breathe in
Hold on while you breathe loud
I see the dawn
Shiver while you breathe in
Hold on while I breath loud

Filigree of time demeaning
Sunset, spoken
Where the wind sings by the river

¿Acaso deseas sentir en ti todos los ojos?
¿Y desencadenar silbidos al pasar?

Mira la escencia, no las apariencias...

De nuestra alma (de nuestra alma) aprisionada (oye)

Lo que hay adentro es lo que vale
Siento en el aire un aroma espiritual

Walking down Parsons Green, I can feel the cold
The leaves in the park are turning brown, I'm 22 years old
Crazy that I was stood right here just five years ago
With the heat on my skin and a lover who's now someone I don't know

You don't see it when it's happening
Happens over time
First you're laughing, then you're crying
Then you can't decide

My life's uncertain and sometimes it's strange
But one thing I've learned is it won't stay the same
Even in the darkness, I'll be okay
The sun will come up, the seasons will change
The sun will come up, the seasons will change
The sun will come up, the seasons will change

Winter comes racing 'round, something about the air
The fire is on and the chimney smoke is tangled in my hair
Crazy how much my life has changed in just a year
There's people I've met, people I've left
And some that didn't make it here

You don't see it when it's happening
Happens over time
First you're laughing, then you're crying
Then you can't decide

I'm in shambles since I blew my 16th candle
It's the little things that I can't handle
And we're still in July
Call me or reach me 'cause I need samples

Some loose change with no more vandals

A melody that's singing, ""You're not fine""

The internet's saying I'm temptatious

Letra de Bailar Contigo
Como te miro
Tengo tu foto en la pared
En el reloj marcan las diez
Y tengo frío
Donde estarás
Por el trabajo me he quedado hasta
Muy tarde
Me voy corriendo a buscarte
Ya no me puedo esperar
II
Con un suspiro
Solo te puedo imaginar
Ilusionada por llegar al paraíso
(Pre)
Como estarás
Oigo la radio
De camino hacia tu casa
La felicidad me abraza
Porque te voy a encontrar
Con tu vestidito de coctel
Tu carita encantadora
Y tu cuerpito angelical
Ya se ven las luces del lugar
Tú me llevas de la mano
Y se oye la orquesta afinar
(Coro)
Bailar contigo
Es la certeza de cumplir
Con mi destino
Mi boleto para entrar al paraíso
Bailar contigo
Como te miro
Cuando cantas
Y te apartas de mi lado
O prefieres que bailemos
Abrazados
Es comprender
Que eres la luz en mi camino
III
Sin un respiro
Yo no te dejo de pensar
Ya nada puede separar
Nuestro camino
Como estarás
Oigo la radio
De camino hacia tu casa
La felicidad me abraza
Porque te voy a encontrar
Con tu vestidito de coctel
Tu carita encantadora
Y tu cuerpito angelical
Ya se ven las luces del lugar
Tú me llevas de la mano
Y se oye la orquesta afinar
(Coro)
Bailar contigo
Es la certeza de cumplir
Con mi destino
Mi boleto para entrar al paraíso
Bailar contigo
Como te miro
Cuando cantas
Y te apartas de mi lado
O prefieres que bailemos
Abrazados
Es comprender
Que eres la luz en mi camino

Course
I will hold you tight never let you go
Tomorrow's party will never end
Like a bud in spring our love will
Bloom and grow
Your eyes to me are precious stones
On a face that's made of a solid gold
When I hold your hand I want to cry
And your loving arms to protect me
From the could you are my world
The soul inside now belongs to you
I'm drowing in a love so deep
We will overcome those ups and
Downs
So happiness is forever ours to keep
I will follow you to the end of time
I will be the blood flowing through your veins
I will ride with you till the end of the
Line
You will be my everything; my world

Crazy
Oh, oh, oh oh

Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumping, it's easy to see

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
Oh, oh

Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wasting my feelings on you
Every time I look at you, my heart is jumping
What can I do?

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, crazy, but it feels alright

He'll be the fool running through the church yard screaming out ""it's not too late""

He's the drunk man with bad breath coming home on too strong
He's the beauty queen that strings your heart along
And he'll answer every question in your new-age magazine wrong
But I know you'll love him strong

He's the elephant in the room that never speaks
But you dream about him every two weeks
And I wouldn't know his name, but you call it in your sleep
Oh I know you love him deep
So run back to him like you should
I guess I always knew that you would
For he's captured your heart in a way I never could
So go on and love him good
So I'm leaving for there's nothing to believe in

Das Leben macht Spaß, ja, du bist 'n Star, yeah
Isst von goldenen Löffeln und fickst schöne Frau'n
Zehntausend km/h, doch du gibst noch Gas
Und brauchst nie wieder Schlaf, denn du lebst den Traum
Doch wozu Girls, Cash, pretty things
'N wunderschönen Benz in weiß?
Und all der ganze fancy Scheiß?
Du stehst vor hunderttausend Fans und weißt:
Irgendwann ist der Moment vorbei
Und ich wollt' eigentlich Unendlichkeit

Scheiß auf Money, scheiß auf Bitches und Karrierescheiß
Ich wurde nicht weil ich gut ficke bei den Apes gesignt
Scheiß auf Platin und das Business, denn es geht vorbei
Keine Zeit, das hier ist mein Ticket in die Ewigkeit
Und wenn es gut läuft, hab' ich siebzig Jahre Lebenszeit
Um zu verhindern, dass die Seele kilometerweit
Schwerelos ins Leere treibt, bitte Gott, steh mir bei
Dass am Ende dieses Lebens mehr als 'ne Trophäe bleibt
Yeah, yeah, ich weiß, wir hab'n zu wenig Zeit
Doch um was zu reißen, glaub mir, reichen ein paar Megabyte
Es ist schon spät, ich weiß, sorry, doch mir fehlt 'n Reim
Geh schon mal voraus und richte aus, es komm'n 'n Haufen
Neuer Dinge, nach den'n alle sich erinnern, wer ich war
Damals mit der MPC vom Zimmer in die Charts
Ich bin mir sicher, man kann nur gewinnen, wenn man wagt
Die Welt ist nicht genug, ich halt' den Finger Richtung Mars

Das Leben macht Spaß, ja, du bist 'n Star, yeah
Isst von goldenen Löffeln und fickst schöne Frau'n
Zehntausend km/h, doch du gibst noch Gas
Und brauchst nie wieder Schlaf, denn du lebst den Traum
Doch wozu Girls, Cash, pretty things
'N wunderschönen Benz in weiß?
Und all der ganze fancy Scheiß?
Du stehst vor hunderttausend Fans und weißt:
Irgendwann ist der Moment vorbei
Und ich wollt' eigentlich Unendlichkeit

I remember this for life
And now I see much clearer
I'm not scared to die
'Cause I will live forever
I will be alive
In this moment
For eternity
For eternity

So schnell wie alles kam ist es irgendwann vorbei
Und deshalb leb' ich jeden Tag als gäb' es nur noch ein'n, eh
Das Leben ist nicht lang, es ist irgendwann vorbei
Und deshalb streb' ich jeden Tag nach Unendlichkeit

Ey yo, ich hab' so das Gefühl dieser Tag heut wird dope
Reiß alle Fenster raus und dann dreh die Mucke auf
Leg die Fernbedienung weg, Leb den Film so wie ich
Denn mein Nachbar hört jetzt Rap ob er will oder nicht
Ey, ich fühl' mich so fly, (so fly), so fly
Denn ich fühl' mich so fly
Wenn ich rhyme bin ich weit, weit weg
Von dem Streit, Jedem Stress, ganz allein, bleib relaxt
Bin mein eigener Chef, dieses Life ist perfekt

Und immer wenn die Angst mich verfolgt
Und die Zweifel mich fast wieder kill'n
Weil ich nicht weiß was passiert
Ich will schreien, aber bleib lieber still
Und wenn die Zeit nicht vergeht, weil es einfach nicht läuft wie man will
Doch dann kommt diese Melodie, dieses Lied
Ich war nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt

Und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
Und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
Und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
Und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
Und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n

Ist schon klar, manchmal ist es hart
Doch ich sitz nicht zuhaus' und denk' den ganzen Tag nur nach
Wenn Leute sagen, rapp' mal wieder so wie vor 'nem Jahr
Damals warst du noch mein Star - Ist mir sowas von egal
Black on Black - Versace-Dress, Der deutsche Kanye West
Nur nicht ganz so arrogant, bin eher so sympathisch nett
Große Bilder - Art Attack, der Typ der auf sich warten lässt
Doch komm ich auf die Party, dann halt besser deine Barbie fest

Und immer wenn die Angst mich verfolgt
Und die Zweifel mich fast wieder kill'n
Weil ich nicht weiß was passiert
Ich will schreien, aber bleib lieber still
Und wenn die Zeit nicht vergeht, weil es einfach nicht läuft wie man will
Doch dann kommt diese Melodie, dieses Lied
Ich war nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt

Nun gut, mach's schnell, ich hoff', es tut nicht weh
Ich hab' Angst, oje – verdammt, tut es weh?

Ich hab' gelebt, ich war auf dem Planet
Hatte vieles zu erzählen, ist ein riesen Privileg
Und jetzt? Jetzt sterb' ich, werd' irgendwo beerdigt
Und komm' sicher in die Hölle, denn ich war nicht immer ehrlich
Ey yo, Mum, es tut mir leid! Ich hab' versprochen, nicht zu rasen
Doch du weißt doch, wie ich bin, ich lass' zu oft die Leute warten
Deshalb wollt' ich mich beeil'n, dass ich zum Kochen wieder da bin
Und jetzt starr' ich auf 'ne Eiche in 'nem Geschoss von einem Wagen

Vollmond, sieben Euro
Drei Homies und 'ne Flasche Billigwodka aufm Volvo
'N ganz normaler Abend mit den Boys und
Was damals so banal war, ist auf einmal von Bedeutung
Privatjet, hier oben ist es leise
Die Bande feiert wild meine Millionen und die Preise
Menschen werden Tiere wegen Drogen, Bitches, Scheine
Ich war mittendrin daneben, aber irgendwie alleine
Seychell'n, sie rennt ins Meer – türkise Well'n
Ich mach' 'n Foto, das schönste der Welt
Sieh' ihre Haare auf dem Moped ohne Helm
Und die feuerrote Sonne kracht in Slomo in die Well'n
Alles Flick, wir bleiben Silvester in Paris
Und dein Lächeln brannte sich in mein Gedächtnis, als du schliefst
Und ich versprech' mir, ich vergess' dich wirklich nie
Hab' genug von Randombitches und den Nächten in Berlin

Ich bin da, ich sehe sie klar
Meine Geburt und Mama lächelt unter Trän'n, hält mich fest – oh mein Gott, ist mir warm!
Hab' endlich 'n Zahn
Vier Kinder grinsen um die Wette, jede VHS-Kassette voller herrlichem Kram
Daddy, guck her! Ich kann fahr'n
Und Mädchen find' ich ätzend, doch ich lande mit sechzehn mit Jessy im Bett
Und versprech', sie zu retten, doch brech' ihr stattdessen nach etlichen heftigen Nächten
Direkt vor dem Essen ihr Herz – ich hoff', es schmeckt

Der Mercedes ist schick, athletischer Schnitt
So böse, aber edel und schlicht
Und jeder Sitz wildleder-bestickt
Ich fass' ihn an, schließ' die Augen und fahr' gegen den Strich
Und ja, Mann, ich erinner' mich noch good
Damals schon im Rover wie Gewinner durch die Hood
Ich bin auf der Rückbank, alle stoned von dem Kush
Es ist Sommer und der Bass drückt durch den Bauch in die Brust
Ich hab' übertrieben Lust und fühle, dass es muss
Fick auf alle andern, Mann, die lügen wie gedruckt
Die Hälfte meiner Jugend nur in Zügen und im Bus
War am üben, doch ich wollte nie auf Bühn'n – das ist Stuss
Die Zeit verging so schnell, wohin mit all dem Geld?
Fünf-Sterne-Hotels, unvernünftig bestellt
Und ich hab' ständig nur Rekorde gebrochen
Und gottverdammte Scheiße, ich bin in den Orbit geschossen

Ich kann geh'n, ich hab' alles geseh'n
Denn ich hab' all die Motherfucker, die mich immer wieder stoppen wollten
Einfach versenkt, einfach versenkt
Hab' mich verloren in den Dingen, die mir wichtig sind
Und deshalb war ich immer zu spät, war immer zu spät
Und nein, ich hab' nicht so getan als wär' mir alles scheißegal
Verdammt, ich hab' es gelebt, ich hab' mich gelebt
Und wenn das hier die letzte Nachricht von mir wär'
Dann würd' ich sagen, ich hab's vor euch geseh'n


Baby, I know, darkness is everything
And I'm feelin' so alone
Baby, I know your love but I would never know you-ou
But I'm feelin' so alone
Why you gotta lie to feel like you're so?
And in my head there's talking, alone

'Cause the leaves are brown
The leaves are brown
The leaves are brown
The leaves are brown

Send me a sign, send me a sign
Baby, I know, time must change everything
And I'm feelin' so hollow, hollow
Baby, I know, here am I
Why don't you think that I'm the one?
The way you've got a lot to love, that's my 
But in my head—

'Cause the leaves are brown
The leaves are brown

The leaves are brown

This shit right here for my Oodles o' Noodles babies
His ma’ smoked the crack while she was pregnant so he can't even help that he crazy
He goin' to jail, it’s inevitable, forreal

I ain't have nobody to give me no hope
I hope my momma ain't doin' no coke
I used to wish that my daddy was livin'
I had a dream that I seen him as ghost
I used to act up when I went to school
Thought it was cool, but I really was hurt
Wanted my family to come to my games
My mama couldn't make it 'cause she was at work
Lived with my grandma, she took me to church
Really no I ain't wanna go
Remember I kissed my aunt in the casket
And her forehead was cold
I was like 4 years old
We couldn’t afford no clothes
It was hand me down
Who would think a nigga get a Grammy now?
Got a black judge tryna tear me down
All this jail time probably wear me down
Turn the lights off in the bathroom
Screaming, ""Bloody, Bloody, Bloody Mary"" now
Havin’ nightmares about Candyman
With the tool on me like a handyman
Killed my lil' cousin, I’m like, ""Damn it, man""
Had to see the footage on a camera, man
On the pavement, with his brains out
With the white sheet, he was laid out
Wanna ask 'Ye, ""Is this a choice?""
It was like this when I came out
What the fuck is you really complaining 'bout?
I know niggas that's never gon’ make it out
This that shit you won't see in the media
Poor get poorer and the rich gettin' greedier
Lot of daddies goin' back and forth out of jail
Lot of sons growin' up and repeating them
This the belly of the beast, you won't make it out
Man, this shit was designed just to eat us up
And my momma told, ""Nigga, keep it up
You gon' end up in prison, just sweepin' up""
Remember, nobody never believed in us
When they see us now, they can't believe it's us, no

I think it's funny how
We used to go to school, play SEGA's
And then, next thing you know, you runnin' 'round with Glock .40s
We ain't never believed in the police, they was shootin' us

Yeah, they called it the projects, they put us in projects
What they gon' do with us? Can't call the cops yet
You might just get popped at
'Cause they the ones shootin' us
I'm on my mom's steps, it's like a bomb threat
The violence pursuing us, I ain't meet God yet
'Cause I'm on the block where
It's just me and Lucifer, look what they do to us
They know we in poverty
When I went to court, the judge said, ""Meek, you a menace to society""
Huh, you said, you would give me a chance, your honor, why would you lie to me?
16 more years of probation, you know you gon' get some more time on me, huh
Whole hood goin' crazy, babies havin' babies
She was fourteen, actin' like she eighty
Got pregnant by a nigga that was locked up in them cages
And the story goes on, if you make it, you amazing (Word up)

See, I got homie that's a billionaire
And I be tryin' to explain it to him like
If your mom ain't on crack or if she got a job and she doing eight hours a day
And your daddy in the graveyard or in the jail cell, who the fuck gon' babysit?

Silken dream to flight
As the darkness gave way to dawn
You've survived
Now your moment has arrived
Now your dream has finally been born
Black Butterfly
Sailed across the waters
Tell your sons and daughters
What the struggle brings
Black Butterfly
Set the skies on fire
Rise up even higher
So the ageless winds of time can catch your wings
Ooh...ooh
While you slept
The promise was unkept
But your faith was as sure as the stars
Now you're free
And the world has come to see
Just how proud and beautiful you are

Sailed across the waters

Set the skies on fire

So the ageless winds of time can catch your wings
Let the current lift your heart
And send it soaring
Write the timeless message clear across the sky
So that all of can read it
And remember when we need it
That a dream conceived in truth can never die

Cause now that you're free
And the world has come to see

I can't explain exactly what I'm doing standing in the rain
Don't do it for fun
Do it if you feel it
Kiss it on the tongue
I'm taking my thoughts to a railway station
Put 'em on a train just to see what's coming back
What's coming back
It's coming like a heart attack
Ice melts too fast
So nothing stays forever nothing's gonna last
She's dressed in black
A black that ends in nowhere and I just got to have her back
And I'm television sick and I'm television crazy
No one works so hard just to make me feel so bad

Acaricio tu rodilla
Y bebo sorbo a sorbo
Tu mirada angelical
Y respiro de tu boca
Esa flor de maravilla
Las alondras del deseo
Cantan, vuelan, vienen, van
Y me muero por llevarte
Al rincón de mi guarida
Donde escondo un beso
Con matiz de una ilusión
Se nos va acabando el trago
Sin saber que es lo que hago
Si contengo mis instintos
O jamás te dejo ir
Y es que no sabes lo que tú me haces sentir
Si tú pudieras un minuto estar en mi
Tal vez te fundirías
En esta hoguera de mi sangre
Y vivirías aquí y yo abrazado a ti
Y es que no sabes lo que tú me haces sentir
Que no hay momento que yo pueda estar sin ti
Me absorbes en espacio
Despacio me haces tuyo

Si se me puede notar
En cada palabra que digo
En cada besosuspiro
Que alguna noche de olvido
Extravie por esos rumbos
Buscandote como lo voy a negar
No hay camino ni lugar
Que no haya recorrido yo
En mi afan de seguir extrañandote
Como se extraña el amor
Con lagrimas en la voz
En cada latido del cuerpo
Sigue mi mente nombrandote
De tanto pensar y pensar
Dejo dormir sin soñar
Se multiplican las letras de tu nombre
Tu me quieres borrar de tu historia
Yo me niego a partir
Tu me quieres olvidar
Pero yo voy a seguir amandote
Me duelen las manos de tanto morderlas
Amandote me duele la vida de tanto rodar
Por ahi, nesecitandote y amandote
Los dias se pasan las noches se inventan amandote

Y solo me queda el vacio de vivir sin ti

Como negar que estoy enamorado
Y quiero volver a empezar

Y yo sigo amandote como lo voy a negar
Con lagrimas en la voz con lastima de mi mismo
No hago mas que recordar
Y yo sigo amandote como lo voy a negar
Como he de negar que sigo amandote
Si sigo soñandote buscandote en cualquier lugar
Como se extraña el amor vivo extrañandote
Como se busca la felicidad sigo buscandote

Should I keep you guessing?
Cause after all it’s done
I have learnt my lesson
But there’s something different about this time
Something clearer about my mind
And now I’m leaning towards your dreaming
As all my dreaming runs wild, circus child
It’s been a long, long time
Since I left my window
But what was there to find
But stacks of broken arrows?
Now I’m burning the clothes I wore
Now I’m shedding the sights I saw
And I hope no spaces can hide your aces
Cause all my aces are played, circus babe

Forget your teenage demons

And they both work as well
I'm coming clean for Amy
Julie doesn't scream as well
And the cops won't listen all night
And so maybe I'll be over

And I can remember when I saw her last
We were running all around and having a blast, having a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in
Is so lonely without you

I was out cruising without you

Crying on Saturday night

You go viciously, quietly, away
I'm sitting in the bedroom
Where we used to sit and smoke cigarettes
Now I'm watching, watching you die
I can remember when I saw her last
We were running all around and having a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in
Is so lonely without you
I know when you're home
I was thinking about you
There was something I forgot to say
I was crying on Saturday night
I was out cruising without you
They were playing our song
Crying on Saturday night
Crying on Saturday night
Crying on Saturday night

How come knots always loosen?
Guess I tie myself to the loose ends
But I push, I press
I lost my bets
And who knows if I'll get ’em back?
How do kings lose their fortune?
Isn't love based on devotion?
But I push, I press
Got 25 statues on my chest
And who knows if I'll get ’em off?
Now all I got left is my pulse
All I got left is my pulse
Trying to get it all back
'Cause I gave away everything
Everything gets lost

Doctor, look into my eyes
I've been breathing air, but there's no sign of life
Doctor, the problem's in my chest

Forgive the kids
For they don't know how to live
Run the alleys, casually

Cruel, cruel

Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
If you could want that, too

They could take or leave you
So they took you and they left you
How could they be casually

Blowing fastly so they can’t see you

Take off all of your skin
And breathe when you are free
Shake off all of your sins
And give them to me
Close up, lemme back in
I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
And my heart beats

We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wildfire every single night

And you touch me

Ayo, ayo, ayo, high potency Thai, smoke a bag of black
And feel the vibe, born to be wise, we form on a rise
The corner mean five, horns in disguise, throw on your slides
Young niggas racist, smokers is basing
We seen the eyes laying up, playing the cut, what?
Stay in the truck, something told me duck, folded me up
My shoulders struck out of luck, fucked the Pradas up
Fell in a daze like a Golotta snuff, niggas tried to body me up
I'm in the lobby bleeding, niggas in the waiting office probably eating
And sprinting and beefing when they heard the shots called the precinct
And seen barber nieces beast, some niggas shot Shallah features
And shot through his Ellesses, bent the spinal cordless creatures
I'm gagging and flagging a cab down
Guess who in the Benz wagon, dragging my sound down macking
It was Dale Breedy the greedy, conniving-ass snake genie
Cop with a bikini who murdered Tosh and Benini
I'm feeling wheezy and I'm drained from the cheeba grieving
Ain't even looking decent, seeing police niggas reaching

That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my...

Fleeing the crime scene speeding
Beefing leaving behind cream, not even peeping that I was leaking
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
Still jakes are creeping, don't blow your spot, stay the weekend
Keep the Ruger peeling who's squealing few knew the dealings
Keep the steel concealed in cause we got no time for feelings
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing
Feel like, a superhero talking like a true Deniro
They boost his ego found him broke down, reduced to zero
Cops fill reports hoping I'll reveal my source, source

That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my soul

Outside the check cashing, flashing, dipped in fashion
Five cherry-faced faggots tried to cash in
They keep laughing – Ghost, you'll get your face bashed in
Who gave you these privileges son? Why you maxing?
And we... fiending to take those
Move slow, I'm hearing how you broke Rob's nose
And I heard you keep a banging hammer, golden brass
Diamonds embroideries that was stolen that you haven't reported, G
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup
Don't make this big stick up bigger, me and the boys
I thought for a second, then chose rather than froze
Had the Gem Star in my hand... yo, what the fuck?
Yo, that's when I ripped Timothy, snatched and dipped
Jumped right in back of him, had the mini axe tool, faxed him
Shots rang off, bing-boggle-de-dum


The sword it's the best weapon of all
Two sharp edges, and a long spine
The blade is very thin and it's easily damaged
You remember that: the vital thing is the point
Pay special attention to it, your life could depend on it

I ain't trying to be no D-boy, I love music, I'm a b-boy
Are you the undercover or the decoy
I'm heavy with the D, Trouble T Roy
A pit with no muzzle about to bust your bubble like a keloid
Too much marijuana got me p-noid
I'm killing instrumentals with that All So Simple Can It Be, boy
Shout to Lil Cease, B.I.G., boy
And Funk Doctor Spock, I mean Redman that's not Leonard Nimoy
88 keys on the keyboard
I'm down to catch wreck, take them first three letters out of record
It's Meth, you heard it through the wire I could be more
Or washed up like Sonny Black's body on the seashore
That's a problem, I could be yours
A monster without the mad scientist and Igor
I've heard it before, a third of these boys
Got murder raps and never even murdered before

Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block

Codename Sensei, I live what my pen say
Game hall of fame, flow is MJ, Muy caliente
Je m'appelle Rebel, capisce, comprende?
Son I'm touching 'em up, trust I'm like
Justin Tuck how they ducking the rush
Tryna break bad, you catch a bad break
Like I own a bake shop how I stack cakes
Greatness was nothing, Deck the next Nike ad
Wifey bad and my life got 'em slightly mad
'Cause I shine like chrome in July
Soldier I opened your eyes, notice the lies
DEA say I'm drugging 'em
I get you leaning hard, I get the fiends to nod, I mean they loving 'em
All hail your highness, terrific win
Put a so-called beast in his place, Pacific Rim

I don't give a fuck, yo, the drama never ends
I'm a project nigga, I don't care about the Benz
Plus I had a lot of chicks, you can have those bitches
But I murder your bloodclot if you touch my riches
Yeah crazy ass skipper, I be in the slums, nigga
Fuck where I come from I'm a quiet gangster nigga
First I get you comfortable, then I start shanking niggas
Park Hill code is don't violate the family
Brother to brother it's no snakes in the amnesty
I come through wilding on some Wu-Tang Can It Be..
Googly-eyed nigga, chop his face in the ministry
Never scared to do the time, fuck the penitentiary
Leave a bunch of dead niggas, don't forget to mention me
The angel of rap, the un-ordinary light
Already did what I was gonna do before you even got the mic

We left a large solar cloud distinguished by size
Interaction with the wise and civilized
The mind caused matter to fall into a center
A great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
From out of this collision
The central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
Each drop full of Hip Hop energy
Balanced on all sides such great symmetry
The bars unlocked the power of the stars
The mirror in the telescope pinpoint the gods
From a distance, acting as a guiding coach
Analyze the board, universal approach
Retune the soul to a certain pitch
Changing the frequency frequently, hitting a certain switch
The love is paramount, the connect is brotherly
Respect for the intellect and broad discovery

Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block

They're very trick so you must be very careful
Uh, Brother Fay's quite right
But still we have been taught that man is good
And if he wasn't good Buddha would not try to help him

Feel so alone the dark will swallow me ye ye ye ye yeah

Will you witness me in a pit of fire
A blazing light atop a golden spire
Sing ohh
Everything comes to an end

And go on acting like it's all gone to plan

It's not simple to say
That most days I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron, that place and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them
It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used to be, although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl
She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine
It's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a backdoor
And carves out a person and makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you
And you're not what I asked for
If I'm honest, I know I would give it all back
For a chance to start over and rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew
Who'll be reckless, just enough
Who'll get hurt, but who learns how to toughen up
When she's bruised and gets used by a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day 'til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little, to bring back the fire in her eyes

Maybe I am foolishly in love with
Someone that is
Not exactly on the same page that I am on
Well, all my friends keep telling me stop
Walking round so blindly
But when he calls they're not around
To ever remind me

Maybe this isn't love
But if it isn't love
Then really what is love?
Maybe I will never really know what's love
'Cause when he's around
He's got me feeling some kind of way
Maybe this isn't love
But if it isn't love
Then really what is love?
Maybe I don't need to know
What's really love
'Cause when he's around
He's got me feeling some kind of way

I guess I kind of notice
He don't always act so kindly
But that doesn't stop my hunger
Hunger for his heart
Now should I listen to those
Who think that I should move on
Maybe what they see as drama
I see more as art


Can't seem to get past how he makes me feel
May not be love but it feels so real
Can't go with what they say
Must follow my heart
But now is that even being true to me
Maybe I'm happy, truly content
Maybe this is as good as it gets
Do I have faith in my confidence
Or am I just thinking all hopelessly
 X2
Got me feeling some type of way ...

Scared enough that you drink when you’re low
And then you made me cry on the train
Don’t need to hide tears in the rain

Rubbed my back after saying you hated me
But I don’t hate her, I’m just trying to save her

I've been the girl with her skirt pulled high
Been the outcast never running with mascara eyes
Now I see the world as a candy store
With a cigarette smile, saying things you can't ignore
Like, Mommy, I love you
Daddy, I hate you
Brother, I need you
Lover, hey, ""Fuck you""
I can see everything
Here with my third eye
Like the blue in the sky

Unaffected by rumors, the truth, I don't care
So open your mouth, stick out your tongue
You might as well let go
You can't take back what you've done
So find a new lifestyle
A new reason to smile
Look for Nirvana

Sequins and sex dreams
You whisper to me
There's no reason to cry

I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high, hypnotized
In a trance
From his body, so buttery brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help
From this feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath

Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet

Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?

I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallowed my pride
Let it ride and partied
But this body felt just like mine
I got worried
I looked over to the left
A reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head

Told me let it be and put some diesel in my trunk
Now I'm riding through the city, baby, turn that shit up

I get my best shot and lately I ain't miss once
He don't say he love me, he just try to act dumb

If you make your bed, then you gotta sleep alone

Me enseñaste a no fumar sin desayuno
Me enseñaste a dividir
Que la suma de uno y uno siempre es uno
Si se aprende a compartir
Me enseñaste que los celos son traviesos
Que es mitad falta de sesos y mitad inseguridad
Me enseñaste a ser pareja en libertad
Me enseñaste que el amor no es una reja
Y que es mentira la verdad
Me enseñaste que no es bueno el que te ayuda
Sino el que no te molesta
Me enseñaste que abrazado a tu cintura
Todo parece una fiesta
Me enseñaste muchas cosas de la cama
Que es mejor cuando se ama
Y que es también para dormir
Me enseñaste entre otras cosas a vivir
Me enseñaste que una duda puede más que la razón
Pero fallaste mi gurú
Se te olvidó enseñarme que hago si no estás tú
***
Me enseñaste de todo excepto a olvidarte
Desde filosofía hasta como tocarte
A saber que el afrodisiaco más cumplidor
No son los mariscos sino el amor
Pero no me enseñaste a olvidarte
Me enseñaste de todo excepto a olvidarte
A convertir una caricia en una obra de arte
A saber que los abogados saben poco de amor
Y que el amor se cohibe en los juzgados
Pero no me enseñaste a olvidarte
Pero no me enseñaste a olvidarte
Donde se apaga el amor que quedó
No encuentro el interruptor
Si hay que aceptar que nuestra historia voló
De donde saco el valor

Una y otra vez
Algo se quebro
Y se detuvo el tiempo
Noche tras noche
Llenos de pasión
Horas de ilusion
De besos es un derroche
Y hoy me dices que te vas
Que eso ya llego al final
Te pido

Porque se parte

Donde refugiarnos
La felicidad
De estar siempre a tu lado
No te tienes que marchar

Is life just a playground?
Think you're the real deal, honey?
And someone will always look out for you?

Estoy llorando en mi habitación
Todo se nubla a mi alrededor
Ella se fue con un niño pijo
Tiene un Ford fiesta blanco
Y un jersey amarillo
Por el parque les veo pasar
Cuando se besan lo paso fatal
Voy a vengarme de ese marica
Voy a llenarle el cuello
De polvos pica pica
Sufre mamón, devuélveme a mi chica
O te retorcerás entre polvos pica pica
Sufre mamón, devuélveme a mi chica
O te retorcerás entre polvos pica pica
Le quemamos su jersey
Y se ha comprado cinco o seis
Voy a destrozarle el coche
Lo tengo preparado, voy esta noche
No te reirás nunca mas de mí
Lo siento nene vas a morir
Tú me quitaste lo que mas quería
Y volverá conmigo, volverá algun dia

Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless

Now I can’t find the key without you

And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete

And under the window sill, they all were found
A touch of concrete within a doorway, without a sound

And take away, all these pills
And please just save me, if you can
From my blasphemy, in my wasteland

How did I get here, and what went wrong
Couldn't handle forgiveness, now I'm far, beyond gone
And I can hardly remember, the look of my own eyes
How could I love this, my life's so dishonest, it made me compromise

Pasa la angustia tan cerca de mi
Cuando de aquí te alejas
Sé que el insomnio sigue por ahí
Esperando que intente dormir
Me he quedado solo
Y así no planeaba vivir
Me he quedado solo
Y sin ti es tan fácil volverse loco
Estoy tocando fondo
Me niego a estar sin ti
Te tengo que recuperar
O de una vez dejarte ir
Estoy tocando fondo
Me duele hablar de ti
No quiero disimular
El resto de mi vida
Fue de la angustia hablarme de ti
Cuando de aquí te alejas
Sé que el insomnio sigue por ahí

Cuando pienses que el amor
Se ha olvidado de que estás ahí
Vuela vuela con tu imaginación
Si no puedes ser felíz
No te rindas, puedes recurrir
Vuela vuela con tu imaginación

Volando encontrarás un mundo nuevo
Sólo déjate llevar

Vuela, vuela
No te hace falta equipaje

Verás que todo es posible

Si estás solo en un rincón
Y la tristeza entra en tu corazón

Donde el cielo se una con el mar

Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better to never ask why

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

Eh, eh, eh

Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

Ever worried that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me are you just getting by by by

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try

Mami, como quisiera detener el tiempo
Que nadie moleste, apaga el celular
Dice que yo la pongo mal
No lo puede evitar
En mi cama te quiero probar (probar)
Se pasa en mí celu chequiando
Que puta me anda llamando
Y ya yo se la quite al jevo (se la quite al jevo)
Llevo dándole como un mes entero
(This is the remix)

Porque tú eres solo mía y él lo tiene que entender
Que solo chinga conmigo y aquí el cabrón es él
Que no te esté llamando, dile que lo estoy buscando
Si lo pillo por ahí le mando (¡brrr!, por ahí le mando, the Real G)

Quiere sentirlo por dentro
Y que la rompa de mil manera
Viene borracha en un leggins sin panty
Me pone bellaco y me la como entera (Pepe)
Tiene el toto afeita'o, bien perfuma'o
'Toy alucinando y no te he proba'o
Quédate en cuatro desnu'a completa
Que hoy vas a temblar como nunca has tembla'o
Se graba pa' Snapchat mientra la azoto
Le doy corrientaso y la derroto
La dejo venia durmiendo en la cama
Por que de ese charco soy el piloto
Es una demente no es ninguna pendeja
De ninguna puta mi baby se deja
Y tira pa' lante va to'a conmigo
Puta que le ronque le parte la ceja (Bryant Myers)

Ya cambie el cheque en el Scotia
Afeitate la chocha y las pierna', mera mi herma
Hoy voy a buscarla cuando tú te duerma'
Si tú no le contesta el se encuerna
Y si no te lo meto tú te enferma
Y siempre que estamo' chingando
Y me vengo te gusta tragarte mi esperma
Diabólica, conmigo tú te viene más rico cuando tamo' fornicando
Y tu marido esperándote
Demonia, yo lo voy a matar si se entera que 'tamo chichando
Aunque tú eras del el, pero él estaba picheando

Porque tú eres solo mía y él lo tiene que entender
Que solo chinga conmigo y aquí el cabrón es él
Que no te esté llamando, dile que lo estoy buscando
Si lo pillo por ahí le mando (por ahí le mando, Austin La Marash)

Papi, 'tate tranquilo
Que ella no está contigo
Si no llega su destino
Juralo anda conmigo
Todo se lo consigo
De eso ella es testigo
Y cuando yo le meto a ella le llega hasta el ombligo
Duro bien duro como tiene que ser
Fuerte, fuerte hasta el amanecer
Que vuelva contigo no se va a poder
¿Cómo te lo hago entender?
Que yo le doy duro, pero mucho más duro
Que lo que tu llamas duro yo si que le doy duro (Wouu!)
Con ella me curo
En la cama yo le rompo ese culo (¡prah!)

Termino adentro, lo saco y te lo meto otra vez
Uno punto diez
Me sobre sede
Te pongo al revés, bebé
No sé es que como puedes
Chingando me arreglas el clima
Cuando de espalda te subes encima
Si duro te doy, duro te arrimas
Así el bicho te lastima
Leruu, no me hables de fingir
Leruu, que tú y yo somos infieles
Cuando te jalo por el pelo
Te encantas si te encanto y haciéndolo te vienes

Porque tú eres solo mía y él lo tiene que entender
Que solo chinga conmigo y aquí el cabrón es él
Que no te esté llamando, dile que lo estoy buscando
Si lo pillo por ahí le mando (Por ahí le mando)

Le mando (Mami)
Dile que tu eres mi bebé
El único que te hace venir (yeh)
El que saca tiempo para ti (yeh)
(Tú te sientes bien donde mi)
Yo sé que tú no habías visto un nene como yo
Que te haga sentir como yo
Que tenga más piquete que yo
Y que a los 23 sea multimillo'
Le gusta mi mansión por todos los lugares
En la puerta tiene la huella digitales
Quiero hacértelo encima de todas mis naves
¿En cual quieres primero? ¿En el Porsche o en el Ferrari?

Mami, ponte las Yezzy
Que yo me voy de Ferragamo o de Giuseppe
Que hoy no va hacer lo mismo, baby
Después que yo me empepe
Quitate la ropa,  quédate desnu'a
Quiero que encima te trepes
Tu novio que la baje que la 19 es fulete
Yo de nadie dependo
La calle con Genius prendía la tengo
La saa y las Endo
To' el mundo llamando a darle queja al Ñengo
Tú sabes que después que prendo
Yo soy el único que el toto te enciendo (Baby)
La movie te ciega, tranquila, baby, que yo entiendo
To' el mundo te conoce
Tranquila mami, a mí también me conocen
Baby, ponte en la pose
Todo cambia después de un par 5-12
Tú quieres que yo me lo saque
Y te baje ese panty que ahí te lo roce
Y volvemos y lo hacemos ante el Check Out a la 12

Porque tú eres solo mía y él lo tiene que entender
Que solo chinga conmigo y aquí el cabrón es él
Que no te esté llamando, dile que lo estoy buscando
Si lo pillo por ahí le mando (brr)
(Por ahí le mando)

(Anuel)
Tú eres mi pistola y yo soy tu chip
Me siento como un demonio cuando estoy adentro de ti
Yo me echo tres Percos, te meto este bicho
Y te pongo a brincar, tú encima de mí
Mámame el bicho, bebé, en mi cuello tengo quince mil

Yo no estoy a favor na' con la pega'era de cuerno
Pero me manda una foto con el culo mirando pa' acá
Dime adonde es que no vamo' a verno'
Las teta' son echa' pero el culo e'natural en Bol killer
Ella quiere acapella pero no estamo' en el estudio
Si no hay condón mejor le huyo (Huyo)
El toto bien lindo que cualquiera le baja pal pozo
En verdad lo único que me detiene
Es que yo sé que te la chingar con tu esposo
Me estas tentando tu sabe, no te lo voy a negar
Pero pa' la próxima vez si quiere que te la mame
Tiene que darte una ducha vaginal (Una ducha vaginal)

(Ozuna)
Una mujer empresaria solo quiere de mí
Tiene lo de ella no quiere fronteo, no la ven por ahí
Usa vestido de Valentino
No quiere oro, le encanta el platino
Le pone mal mi fragancia
Dice que yo soy su negro fino
Copas de vino
En el cuarto solos, ella y yo
Pide que le haga el amor
Dice que quiere calor
Tú y yo, nos devoramos bien demente
Y yo me pongo mal de la mente, mami

조금씩 같이 걸으면
어디에 있어도 함께일 수 있겠지

밤새워 잠들 수 없는걸

많은 그 비밀

And it's the purest I have found
You're not fine and dandy, and look what I did, won't make it disappear
You're not fine and dandy, oh, now all the frills and the fine stuff feel so ridiculous
When you're, you're not fine and dandy
Pulls me back by the hair as your blue eyes roll back there

Y aunque me le pongan vidrios
Cuello y fondo de botellas
Voy a borrar la pared para
Estar al lado de ella
Quieren hacer imposible
Esta hermosa relación
Sin saber que es invencible
La fuerza de nuestro amor
Para que de mi se olvide me
La tienen secuestrada
Pero cuando nos juntemos
Nos quitaremos las mmmm
Y aunque me le pongan vidrios
Cuello y fondo de botellas
Voy a borrar la pared
Para estar al lado de ella
Se empeñan en separarnos mas
Les es pera el fracaso
Porque al amor verdadero
Nada le impide su paso
Cuando las mujeres quieren
Nadie puede detenerlas
Pues rompen las ataduras
Las cadenas y las cuerdas
Y aunque me le pongan vidrios
Cuello y fondo de botellas
Voy a borrar la pared
Para estar al lado de ella
Y aunque me le pongan vidrios
Cuello y fondo de botellas
Voy a borrar la pared
Para estar al lado de ella
No la dejan ni siquiera
Llegar sola ni a la esquina
Le ponen una custodia
Le montan una vigila
Si no hay prisión para el amor
Ni puede pararlo nada
Allí donde encuentra espacio
Empieza a expandir sus alas
Y aunque me le pongan vidrios
Cuello y fondo de botellas
Voy a borrar la pared
Para estar al lado de ella
Y aunque me le pongan vidrios
Cuello y fondo de botellas
Voy a borrar la pared

No me digas nada
No quiero escucharte
Busca un confidente y cuentale todo
Dile que me hiciste lo que a nadie se le ase
Dile que estoy triste y no voy a resignarme
Y aseptar lo solo porque estas arepentida
Dile que me quieres porquese que me quieres
Y que no pudiste derrotar un desengao
Por un hombre que niciquieras muy vien conoces
Yo se que a ti te duele y estas arepentida
Tu no querias hacerlo pero fuistes muy debil
A mi tambien me duele porque tu eres mi vida
Pero no es nada facil creo que ya no se puede
Porque el corazon no se puede olvidar
Porque mi dolor no se puede borrar
Tan solo porque tu me pidas perdoname
Porque el corazon no se puede olvidar
Porque mi dolor no se puede borrar
Tan solo porque tu me pidas perdoname
Y asi tan facil no es..ahhh ahhh

Te dare mi olvido decirlo es muy facil
Y para cumplirlo me siento impotente
Porque eres la sombra que refleja mi alma
Duele aceptarlo mi corazon te llama
Que dificil es vivir lo que yo estoy viviendo
Rompiste el encanto que de nuestro amor brotaba
Sueos que duramos no de rumbar por nada
Tu los derrumbaste yo quede trapado en ellos
Yo se que aun me quieres permanesco en tu vida
Que bien es esplicarme lo que tanto me duele
Yo no queiro escucharte lastimas no es mi erida
Si quieres desaogarte ve y busca un confidente

Hoy recuerdo tu amor
Como lo que fue muy grande
Me diste tode de ti
Se que no podre olvidarte
Nunca he podido borrarlo
Tu dulce imagen de mi mente
Y anelo volverte a encontrar
Para vivir
Nuestro Amor de ayer
Porque diste a mi vida
La felicidad
Cuando te bese
Por primera vez
Y la gente logro
Con todas sus mentiras
Separarte de mi
Destrozando mi vida
Hoy le pido yo a dios
Volverte a encontrar
Porque nos merecemos
Otra oportunidad
Para irnos bien lejos
Y podernos amar
Donde la gente Mala
No nos pueda encontrar
Y Amarte
Amarte sin fin
Y ya nunca podran
Separarte de mi

Sin ti Amor
Recordando tu calor
Pero si Dios
Lo quiere asi

Yo te vuelva a ver
Te deseo
Con mucho Amor
Que seas feliz

Letra de Fecha De Vencimiento""
Hoy me preguntas
Que como he podido olvidarte
Que como he podido
Acostumbrarme a besar otros labios
Y yo me pregunto si hubieras sido tú, en mi lugar
Si te hubieras pasado la vida entera amando a alguien
A una persona que no le importan tus sentimientos
Dime, que hubieras hecho tú

Tu sabes que te ame como a nadie
Y no te importo nada
Siempre viste, todo a tu alrededor, menos a mi
A ti nunca te ha importado mi amor
Ahora no me preguntes
Que te creíste tu, que eras única
Que jamás podría yo amar a nadie más
Todo tiene su fecha de vencimiento
Y se venció mi amor por ti
Todo tiene su fecha de vencimiento
Y se venció mi amor por ti

Ahora que me vez feliz
Tu quieres cuestionarme
Te interesas por mi
Después que no me valoraste
Y yo me pregunto si hubieras sido tu, en mi lugar
Si te hubieras pasado la vida entera amando a alguien
A una persona que no le importan tus sentimientos
Dime que hubieras hecho tu

Tu sabes que te ame como a nadie
Y no te importo nada
Siempre viste, sodo a tu alrededor, menos a mi
A ti nunca te ha importado mi amor
Ahora no me preguntes
Que te creíste tu, que eras única
Que jamás podría yo amar a nadie más

Sentimientos
Joe Veras
Por tus cartas del verano presentia
Que este año no vendrias a abrasarme
Y a nadie diga nada, que una melancolia me destrosaba el alma
Por el gesto de un amigo que llegaba
Comprendi que hoy tienes otro pensamiento
Y que a este provinciano que te entrego la vida te lo borrado el tiempo
Con razon tanto silencio y nunca quieres decir nada
Con razon alguien me dijo tu novia esta muy cambiada
Tu reputacion la hechaste al suelo junto con mis sueños
Ya no eres esa niña que a la iglesia me invitava
Hoy que tu amor a fallecido y yo me pierdo en el olvido
Sabes bien que tu eres mis mejores tiempos
Rompo tus cartas de verano
Lloro porque yo te amo
Pero a ti te importa poco el sentimiento
Y aqui yo estoy muriendo
Por el gesto de un amigo que llegaba
Comprendi que hoy tienes otro pensamiento
Y que este provinciano que te entrego la vida
Te lo borrado el tiempo
Me contaron que hasta fuma que olvidaste tus amigos
Que comentas en reuniones que nada que ver conmigo
Mientras tanto yo esperando que volvieras a mi pueblo
Pa matarte de un abraso pero no pinte mi sueño
Y hoy que tu amor a fallecido y yo me pierdo en el olvido
Sabes bien que tu eres mis mejores tiempos
Rompo tus cartas de verano
Lloro porque yo te amo
Pero a ti te importa poco el sentimiento
Con razon que mis amigos no me miran a la cara
Con razon que juan me dijo tu novia esta muy cambiada
Mientras tanto yo esperando que volvieras a mi pueblo
Pa matarte de un abrazo yo no realize mi sueños
Y hoy que tu amor a fallecido y yo me pierdo en el olvido
Sabes bien que tu eres mis mejores tiempos

I guess we'll never get started
Let's save the silence all night
No need for talking about it
Sometimes, the quiet feels so right

High
Over the north star
Sleepless, so far
Together, we are
High
Trapped in the holiday affair
A new silence filled the air

I rest my head on your shoulder
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Right there, a little bit slower
Feel free to roll another one for me
(Roll another one for me)

High
Over the north star
Sleepless, so far
Together, we are
High
Trapped in the holiday affair
A new silence filled the air

Making way, we sway, we slide, oh
One flight to space, soothing you
It's too good to be true, have more on a rooftop view
Making way, we sway, we slide, oh

High
Over the north star
Sleepless, so far
Together, we are
High
Trapped in the holiday affair
A new silence filled the air

Hey, remember me?
I've been busy working like crazy
I know you like tangerine
And your kiss is sweet and creamy

Oh, can you imagine
Our friend's fixed for us to bump in
Oh, I'm done looking
Now things can start happening

Hey, remember me?
I've got so much, just come and get me
I played something catchy
You leaned forward and kissed me

First I take you then you take me
Breathe some life into a fantasy
Your lips, warm and fuzzy
I want to run my fingers up your pussy

When I go home too soon, so you change my mind

Persuading me until two to get drunk this time

Paso noches enteras pensando en tu amor
Yo deseando que no estes con el
Pues muy bien sabes que el a ti te engaña
Te daña, y terminas temiendole a el
El no merece tenerte, mi amor
Vivo soñando que no estes con el
Pues muy bien sabes que el a ti te engaña
Te daña, y terminas temiendole a el

Yo solo quiero que olvides su nombre
El a ti te engaña, y eso no es de un hombre
Cuando te deje sola no te asombres
Vente conmigo, y borraras su nombre
Yo solo quiero que olvides su nombre
El a ti te engaña, y eso no es de un hombre
Cuando te deje sola no te asombres
Vente conmigo, y borraras su nombre
Olvida su nombre y su cara
Su calor, su cama, y su almohada
Sus palabras no valen nada
Porque lagrimas tu le dabas
Porque lloras mi amor
Porque le temes dimelo
Porque sigues atada de ese hombre
Que solo te brinda tristeza y dolor
Porque lloras mi amor
Porque le temes dimelo
Porque sigues atada de ese hombre
Que solo te brinda tristeza y dolor
Mientras yo me quedo aqui por ti esperando
En el mismo lugar, en el mismo balcón
Donde te entregue para ti mi corazón
Olvidalo que no es tu dueño...
No es tu dueño.....
No es tu dueño.....

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

Now oh so easily you're over me
Gone is love

I hope you see me there
It's in the water, it's where you came from
It's in the water, it's where you came from

And they cry to see your face

It's in the water, it's in the story, of where you came from
